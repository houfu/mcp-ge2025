## IT IS TIME

## Our Vision For Singapore

Fellow Singaporeans,

As we approach polling day, the Singapore People's Party invites you to reflect on our manifesto addressing today's evolving challenges.

Guided by Accountability , Commitment , and Empathy (A.C.E) , we aim to foster a sustainable and equitable society for all generations.

Building on our 2020 vision, this manifesto incorporates fresh insights to meet Singaporeans' evolving needs holistically.

Join us in shaping a democratic and inclusive Singapore.

Steve Chia Secretary-General

## Theme 1 Economic Stability &amp; Fairness

Rising Costs of Living, Inflation

Singaporeans face rising cost of living with stagnant wages, straining youth saving for the future, families raising children, and seniors with shrinking retirement funds.

## SPP Proposes

- Yearly Balanced Budget: Distribute government budget surpluses annually as CDC vouchers, with more aid for lower-income Singaporeans to ensure a balanced budget.
- GST Freeze: Halt GST increases until the cumulative budget deficit exceeds 3% of government revenue for three consecutive years.
- Living Wage Policy: Expand and implement a living wage policy to ensure low-income workers and families can meet basic needs.
- Progressive Taxation: Raise income tax on the top 2% of earners and reintroduce estate duty for ultra-high-net-worth individuals to fund equitable relief.

## Theme 2 Employment &amp; Job Security

Job Insecurity, Unemployment

Job insecurity-from automation, retrenchment fears, underemployment and foreign talent competition-affects youth entering the workforce, all working adults, and seniors nearing retirement.

## SPP Proposes

- Local Hiring Incentives: Offer tax breaks to businesses prioritising Singaporean PMETs and enforce higher local hiring quotas with a raised Local Qualifying Salary.
- Legal Protections: Codify TAFEP guidelines into law, mandating fair hiring and retrenchment benefits.
- Flexible Retirement: Abolish the statutory retirement age of 63, offering tax incentives for companies hiring seniors past their 70s who choose to keep working.
- Review CECA Agreement: Reassess the CECA agreement with India to address labor inflow concerns.
- Quota Reduction: Gradually reduce Special/Employment Pass quotas and dependency ratios in automatable sectors.
- Encourage Automation: Promote a shift toward a high-skill, highvalue economy with high-tech manufacturing and services.

## Theme 3 Housing and Retirement Security

Housing Affordability, Retirement Adequacy

High private property prices and HDB lease decay trouble Singaporean buyers and owners alike. Young singles and families seeking housing or upgrades, and seniors needing downsizing options must be addressed.

## SPP Proposes

- Singles Citizen HDB Scheme: Lower the minimum age for singles to apply for BTO or resale HDB flats to 30 years old.
- Expanded SERS: Apply Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme to all estates nearing lease expiry to preserve HDB asset value.
- Gradual Ethnic Quota Phase Out: Launch a five-year pilot to relax ethnic quotas in HDB estates, aiding minority flat owners in selling at fair market value.

## Theme 4 Family Support and Birth Rates

Improving Birth Rates

Singapore faces serious declining birth rates. We must take bigger and bolder measures to make parenthood more attractive. Having a second and/or third child to become an asset instead of being perceived as an economic liability. Reward parenthood with big incentives.

## SPP Proposes

- Second-Child Housing Incentives: Help parents of a second child to upgrade to a larger HDB/BTO flat with additional housing grants.
- Third-Child Benefit: Permit families with a third child to purchase a private property without Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) or to upgrade HDB/BTO with a higher grant.
- IVF Subsidies: Provide financial aid for couples needing IVF to start families.

## Theme 5 Governance and Democratic Freedom

Political Freedom, Transparency, Democracy

After 60 years of independence, citizens seek greater transparency, more accountability, and diverse voices in public conversations.

## SPP Proposes

- Proportional Representation: Amend the Constitution to allow proportional representation for smaller parties in Parliament.
- Freedom of Information: Enact a law for public data access to enhance transparency.
- Open Discourse: Ease defamation laws to encourage open public discussion.
- Reduce Waste: Implement a yearly 2% reduction in every Ministry's budget to cut unnecessary spending.
- Fixed Elections: Set fixed election years and dates for a level playing field.
- Independent Elections Commission: Remove the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) from the Prime Minister's office and establish an independent commission for free and fair elections.

## Theme 6 Education and Youth Well-Being

Youth, Education System, and Mental Pressures

Education stresses youth and parents, and seniors are worried about the future generations, amid mental health pressures and a need for relevance.

## SPP Proposes

- Personalised Learning: Reduce class sizes for tailored education.
- Modern Curriculum: Shift to Artificial Intelligence mastery and skills-based reasoning, with less exam pressure and more vocational options.
- Mental Health Support: Expand mental health resources in schools and communities.
- Global Opportunities: Allow CPF use for overseas tertiary education with safeguards.
- Youth Engagement: Lower the voting age to 18 to involve youth in governance.

## Theme 7 Healthcare and Mental Wellness

Healthcare Costs, Accessibility, Mental Health Support

High healthcare costs and mental health challenges burden seniors, youth, and all who are seeking timely care.

## SPP Proposes

- Telehealth Access: Subsidise tele-consultations for elderly and low-income groups.
- Medisave Expansion: Raise withdrawal limits to $1,200 annually for preventive and mental health care.
- Eldercare Support: Subsidise ageing-in-place services and cap out-of-pocket costs with a universal scheme.
- Mental Health Integration: Integrate mental health professionals into polyclinics and National Service institutions.
- Mental Health Leave: Offer five days of unpaid mental health leave.
- Rehabilitation Focus: Ease Mandatory Treatment Orders for offenders with mental disorders.

## Theme 8 Sustainable Public Transport

Public Transportation Challenges, Green Singapore

Public transport serves working adults, youth, and seniors but the costs strain lower-income households as train reliability lags badly. Prioritise the affordability, accessibility, and efficiency of MRT services.

## SPP Proposes

- Reliable MRT: Invest heavily in MRT maintenance to ensure reliability and no major disruptions.
- Subsidised Travel: Provide higher travel subsidies for lowincome families and Silver Support recipients.
- Green Transition: Expedite the full electrification of public service buses from 2040 to 2033.

## Theme 9 Social Cohesion and National Identity

Social Welfare, Inequality, Ageing Population Support, National Service Debates

Inequality, ageing needs, and NS debates impact youth, families, and seniors, testing social unity and national values.

## SPP Proposes

- Minimum Wage: Set a living wage (e.g., $1,500 monthly) to ensure dignity of living.
- Wealth Redistribution: Increase tax reliefs for lowerincome groups, raise top-tier income taxes, and boost CDC vouchers for low-income families.
- Caregiver Support: Offer five days of paid parent-care leave, and subsidise elder-friendly housing and retirement villages.
- NS Reform: Reduce National Service to 18 months and raise NS allowances to 80% of regular pay.

## Our Commitment. Your Decision.

This manifesto is a call to dialogue, reflecting SPP's dedication to a collaborative future. By addressing these 9 themes, we propose a fairer, stronger Singapore where every voice counts, and every need is met. Together, let's build a nation for all generations.

## Brief History of The Singapore People's Party

The SPP was officially registered on 21 November 1994, emerging as a significant player in Singapore's opposition politics led by Mr Chiam See Tong. Mr Chiam represented Potong Pasir in the parliament since 1984, first under SDP and then under SPP since the 1997 General Elections.

In 2011, Mr. Chiam contested in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC while his wife, Mdm Lina Chiam contested in Potong Pasir. Both lost narrowly, and Mdm Chiam was appointed a Non-Constituency MP (NCMP), keeping the SPP's voice alive in Parliament until 2015.

Mr Steve Chia (NSP / SDA), former NCMP and youngest parliamentarian in that 10th Parliament (2001-2006) subsequently joined SPP and was elected Secretary-General in 2019. He credited Mr Chiam as a 'beacon' for guiding him into parliament via the SDA in the 2001 General Elections.

Steve published a book of his Parliamentary speeches and questions, titled "Called to Serve" in 2006. He raised and logged 236 parliamentary mentions in that 4+ years raising issues like taking care of our pioneer generation of elderly citizens (which subsequently inspired the Government's Pioneer Generation package), allow earlier purchase of HDB flats for singles, and greater public transport subsidies, etc.

Under Chia's leadership, the SPP contested the 2020 General Elections in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, securing 32.77%, while Potong Pasir yielded 39.23%. Despite the losses, Steve reflects on his tenacity and resilience in politics, drawing from his ultra trail running-inspired philosophy of pacing for the long haul. He aimed to break the PAP's dominance in parliament, and demand greater accountability and transparency of government policies for all.
