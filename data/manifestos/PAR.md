# People’s Alliance for Reform Manifesto: A Better Singapore for All

## Introduction

At the **People’s Alliance for Reform**, we are committed to building a **fairer, more equitable Singapore** where every citizen enjoys **affordable living, meaningful employment, and true homeownership**. Our vision is to create a society that prioritizes **Singaporeans first**, ensuring prosperity and security for all.

## Our Core Principles

### 1. Lower Cost of Living in Singapore

The rising cost of living in Singapore affects everyone. We aim to:

* **Regulate Essential Prices**: Implement price controls on necessities such as food, healthcare, and transportation.
* **Expand Subsidies**: Increase financial support for low-income families, students, and the elderly.
* **Fair Wages**: Advocate for higher minimum wages to keep up with Singapore’s cost of living.

### 2. Affordable and Sustainable Public Housing

Every Singaporean deserves a **home they truly own**. Our housing reforms will:

* **Increase Affordable Housing**: Develop new HDB flats to meet growing demand.
* **Improve Homeownership Schemes**: Provide better grants and financing options for first-time buyers.
* **Sustainable Developments**: Prioritize eco-friendly housing and community spaces.

### 3. Jobs for Singaporeans First

We will ensure that **Singaporeans have priority in employment** by:

* **Creating More Jobs**: Focus on industries that generate **high-value jobs** for locals.
* **Skills Development**: Invest in **training and upskilling** to prepare Singaporeans for the future.
* **Supporting Local Businesses**: Encourage SMEs and startups to thrive, creating more job opportunities.

### 4. Fair Employment Policies: No Displacement by Foreigners

To protect **Singaporean workers**, we will:

* **Enforce Fair Hiring Practices**: Ensure that Singaporeans are given **priority in job placements**.
* **Regulate Foreign Workforce**: Implement policies that **prevent the displacement** of local workers.
* **Promote Local Talent**: Encourage businesses to invest in **local workforce development**.

## Conclusion

The **People’s Alliance for Reform** is dedicated to a **better Singapore**—where every citizen enjoys **affordable living, job security, and true homeownership**. We invite all Singaporeans to join us in this movement for reform.
