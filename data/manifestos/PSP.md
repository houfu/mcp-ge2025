## Dear fellow Singaporeans,

Your  vote  is  critical  in  this  election.  It  will  decide whether we continue to have credible and responsible elected  Opposition  MPs  who  keep  the  PAP  in  check and hold the PAP to account in a constructive way.

The PAP lost a GRC for the first time during the 2011 General Election. After that, to address Singaporeans' concerns,  the  PAP  tried  to  make  changes,  such  as launching the Pioneer Generation Package and increasing the number of BTO flats built per year. Do you think this would have been done if the PAP had not lost a GRC?

If  only  20,000  voters  voted  differently  last  time,  the PAP would have won all the seats in Parliament. How do you think the PAP would have governed Singapore if that happened?

Elected  Progress  Singapore  Party  MPs  will  always speak up fearlessly for you in Parliament.

Give us a chance to work together with you to find the best way forward for Singapore.

We  will  fight  to  build  a  more  compassionate  and kinder Singapore.

Vote for Progress For All.

Vote for the Progress Singapore Party.

Tan Cheng Bock Chairman Progress Singapore Party

## Dear fellow Singaporeans,

This manifesto contains over 60 policy ideas that PSP believes will help Singapore progress. Hazel and I have presented  most  of  these  ideas  to  Parliament  before, although some are new.

These  policy  proposals  were  often  hotly  debated  in Parliament. Thus, it is unfair for the Government to say that  the  Opposition  has  not  suggested  alternative solutions.

We hope that these policy debates have helped you gain a better understanding of why PSP holds the view that the current government has lost its way.

PSP believes that our ideas can help bring Singapore back  on  the  right  track  and  allow  Singaporeans  to enjoy better lives and livelihoods.

PSP envisions a Singapore where all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language, or religion, can enjoy progress together.

Vote for Progress For All this General Election.

Leong Mun Wai Secretary-General Progress Singapore Party


# Executive Summary

What we stand for:

Building a fair society: We  believe  that  we  should  build  a  society  that  better  balances social and economic considerations. Public policies should not just be  driven  by  economic  concerns,  but  must  also  consider  social objectives. We will make sure that the benefits of economic growth are distributed equitably among all Singaporeans and everyone gets to see improvements in their daily lives as the economy grows.

Living with dignity: We believe that anyone who works hard should be able to live with dignity. Public housing and healthcare should be affordable for all Singaporeans.  The  social  safety  net  should  be  strengthened  and made  easier  to  navigate  so  that  all  Singaporeans  can  enjoy  a dignified standard of living.

More pathways to success in education: We believe that our education system should provide multiple paths to success, so Singaporeans can achieve their fullest potential in the way  that  suits  them  best.  Embracing  diversity  in  education  will better prepare Singaporeans  for a future society that values creativity and social skills that cannot be replicated by machines.

Strengthening democracy and political institutions: We believe that Singaporeans should be able to freely discuss and debate their views to make Singapore a better place. We must build a strong system of checks and balances within our political institutions to prevent abuse of power and ensure that Singaporeans continue to play a vital part in nation building.

## COST OF LIVING

Since  the  last  General  Election  in  2020,  there  has  been  a  major escalation  in  the  cost  of  living  in  Singapore.  The  Consumer  Price Index (CPI) has increased by 18%, from 85.25 in July 2020 to 100.68 in Feb 2025. Of particular pain to consumers was the increase in the CPI for hawker food, which is beloved by Singaporeans. The CPI for hawker food increased by 20% from 84.37 in July 2020 to 101.22 in Feb 2025.

On top of an increase in the general cost of living, the GST rate was also  increased  from  7%  to  9%  with  effect  from  1  January  2024, compounding  the  pain  felt  by  consumers  when  they  were  hit  by rising prices.

Rising  prices  in  housing  and  transport  have  further  added  to  the burden of Singaporeans. The HDB resale price index has increased from 131.9 in Q2 2020 to 197.9 in Q4 2024, an increase of 50% over four years. The price of a Category A COE has almost tripled, going from $33,520 in July 2020 to $94,502 in March 2025, while the price of a 10km adult journey on public transport has increased by 20%, from $1.48 in 2020 to $1.77 in 2024. Even the price of water was increased by about 18% over two phases in 2024 and 2025.

On the other hand, wages have barely kept pace with the relentless increase in prices. The median gross monthly income from employment  (including  employer  CPF  contributions)  of  full-time employed residents increased 21% from 2020 to 2024, from $4,534 to $5,500. This is far lower than the increase in HDB resale flat prices or Category A COE prices, and only slightly more than the increase in  hawker  food  and  public  transport  prices.  It  is  no  wonder  that Singaporeans are finding it difficult to keep up with the rising cost of living.

The  PAP  Government  has  often  blamed  global  conditions  and external  events,  such  as  the  war  in  Ukraine  or  the  post-Covid realignment of the global supply chain, for the rising cost of living in Singapore. It has also touted its many  measures  to support Singaporeans, such as the tightening of monetary policy, enhancements to the Assurance Package, and various other initiatives to help Singaporeans save costs.

While many countries around the world have seen a post-pandemic increase  in  inflation,  Singapore's  economic  model,  championed  by the PAP Government, has also had a role to play in driving inflation.

One of the key drivers of inflation in Singapore is rising land costs and property prices.  As  rents  increase,  the  cost  of  doing  business increases,  especially  in  the  retail  and  food  and  beverage  sectors, and  this  trickles  down  to  consumers  in  the  form  of  higher  prices. Given  that  more  than  80%  of  land  in  Singapore  is  owned  by  the State, the Government has tight control over the price and supply of land  and  real  estate  in  Singapore.  It  has  not,  however,  used  this power as a tool to keep the cost of living in Singapore in check.

The PSP understands the pain that Singaporeans feel over the rising cost  of  living.  Since  2020,  we  have  spoken  up  in  Parliament  and proposed solutions to help Singaporeans deal with the rising cost of living in these areas: (i) GST policy, (ii) property prices and rents, (iii) food prices at hawker centres, and (iv) healthcare costs.

Our proposals are summarised in this section.

## (1) Reduce GST to 7%

In 2022, we opposed the increase in GST. We repeat our call to reduce GST to 7%.

GST is fundamentally a regressive tax, because the rich and poor pay the  same  tax  in  purchasing  everyday  products  and  services.  Even though  those  with  higher  income  spend  more  and  pay  more  GST  in absolute  terms,  those  with  lower  income  will  pay  more  in  GST  as  a proportion of their income. This fact remains unchanged, even if lowerand  middle-income  Singaporeans  receive  cash  support  and  utility rebates through the permanent GST Voucher scheme.

The cash support and utility rebates from the permanent GST Voucher scheme can be funded through more progressive taxes, such as estate duty or a wealth tax. It does not need to be funded by a regressive tax such as GST.

The increase in GST from 7% to 9% when Singapore was facing high inflation  and  recovering  from  an  unprecedented  pandemic  was,  and continues to be, painful to many ordinary Singaporeans.

Singapore's fiscal position is strong. We estimate that our country has approximately  $1.2  trillion  of  financial  reserves,  which  is  equal  to  12 times the Government's annual expenditure. In other words, even if the Government were to stop collecting revenue entirely and relied solely on reserves, our reserves will be enough to sustain the Government's operations  for  12  years.  In  comparison,  an  OCBC  survey  in  2023 showed that more than half of Singaporeans have savings of less than 6 months' salary.

Our reserves are still growing every year. We are also generating higher and higher investment returns from the reserves each year. In fiscal year 2023,  the  investment  returns  from  the  reserves  amounted  to  $47 billion.

We  are  heartened  that  Prime  Minister  Lawrence  Wong  stated  in Parliament in 2024 that there is no need for further GST increases up to 2030. He made this commitment in response to questions in Parliament by the PSP. However, we believe that Singapore's strong fiscal position puts  us  in  a  sufficiently  strong  position  to  reverse  the  GST  hike  and reduce GST to 7%.

## (2) Exempt basic essentials from GST

In 2022, we called on the Government to exempt basic essential goods from GST, and we repeat this call today. Such essential goods should include water, rice, eggs, cooking oil, wheat flour, and formula milk.

We  propose  setting  price  thresholds  on  basic  essentials  that  are exempted from GST. For example, rice that sells for under $2 per kg can be exempted from GST, while rice that sells for above $2 per kg will not be exempted from GST. This will reduce the likelihood of the wealthy  taking  advantage  of  and  benefiting  from  GST  exemptions, because the wealthy are less likely to purchase the cheapest versions of essential items.

## (3) Defer land cost for HDB flats

We propose that HDB stop paying the cost of State Land used for BTO flats into the Past Reserves. Instead, the land cost will be recorded with HDB at the point a BTO flat is sold. It will be deferred and recovered from  flat  buyers  with  accrued  interest,  based  on  historical  mortgage rates, if they subsequently sell the BTO flat on the resale market after the Minimum Occupation Period. The land cost recovered will then be used in a manner explained in the next section.

Currently, HDB is required to pay the cost of State Land used for BTOs into the Past Reserves. In Financial Year (FY) 2023/24, this amounted to $7.5  billion.  Because  HDB  prices  BTO  flats  below  market  value,  it makes a loss,  which  is  paid  for  through  Government  grants  from  the Budget. In FY2023/24, this grant amounted to $6.8 billion, or about 6% of total Government spending.

We do not agree with the current arrangement, as taxpayers and flat buyers  are  effectively  made  to  subsidise  the  land  cost  for  BTO  flats, even though the land is already owned by the State.

We believe that owner-occupied public housing is a public good that should  be  treated  as  essential  public  infrastructure,  like  schools  and hospitals,  where  land  costs  are  not  charged  because  it  is  treated  as State  Land.  We  believe  that  land  used  for  owner-occupied  HDB  flats should be treated in the same way as schools and hospitals.

HDB flat buyers only lease their flats from the State for 99 years. At the end of the 99-year lease, the flat must be returned to the State at zero value.  Singaporeans  who  lease  their  flats  for  owner-occupation  and who never sell their flats on the resale market should not have to pay for  the  land  cost.  Only  those  who  subsequently  sell  their  flats  on  the resale market, and thus derive financial benefits, should pay land cost.

## (4) Review use of land sales proceeds in the Budget

In  2022,  the  PSP  called  on  the  Government  to  review  its  accounting treatment  of  land  sales  proceeds.  We  repeat  this  call  again.  We propose that land sales proceeds should be treated as revenue divided over the period of the lease. This means that if a piece of land is sold on a 99-year lease,  the  proceeds  should  be  taken  as  revenue  spread over 99 years.

Currently,  land  sales  proceeds  go  directly  into  the  Past  Reserves  and cannot  be  directly  spent,  even  though  the  value  of  such  proceeds  is now very large.  The  proceeds  of  land  sales  through  the  Government Land  Sales  programme  averaged  $5.5  billion  annually  from  Financial Year (FY) 2017 to FY2021, and increased to $8.15 billion in FY2023. The Government is  only  allowed  to  spend  50%  of  the  investment  returns from the Past Reserves in each year's Budget. This is known as the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC).

Under the PSP's proposal, if a piece of industrial land was sold on a 20year  lease  and  the  sale  proceeds  were  treated  as  revenue  over  20 years,  the  Government  would  be  allowed  to  draw  5%  of  the  sale proceeds  each  year  for  the  next  20  years  as  revenue  for  use  in  the Budget. This is illustrated below in the form of a table.

## Revenue Stream Over Time

Assumptions:

- 1) Sale of Industrial land on 20 lease vear
- 2) Land sale remain constant for 20 vears

|        |           | Revenue in year   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |     |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|
|        | Land sale | 1                 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20  | 21  | 22  |
| Year   | 100       | 5                 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    | 5   |     |     |
| Year 2 |           |                   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |     |
| Year 3 | 100       |                   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |     |     | 5   |
| Total  |           | 5                 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 50 | 55 | 60 | 65 | 70 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 90 | 95 | 100 | 100 | 100 |

Before the land sales proceeds are drawn on as revenue, they should be invested as part of the Past Reserves so that they can continue to generate returns.

This  proposal  would provide a cumulative revenue stream that would eventually build up to a significant alternative source of revenue for the Government.  It  is  a  sensible  approach  that  does  not  compromise  on financial prudence,  because  Singapore  no  longer  sells  land  on  a freehold basis.  It  is  not  necessary  for  the  Government  to  lock  up  the proceeds  of  land  sales  because  State  Land  will  not  be  forever  gone once sold.

In February 2024, then-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong acknowledged in Parliament that the PSP's proposal was 'not an unthinkable proposition'.  We  repeat  our  call  for  the  Government  to  adopt  the PSP's proposal on the use of land sales proceeds.

## (5)  Fair  Tenancy Industry Committee to issue guidelines on annual rent increases for commercial properties

In  November 2023, the PSP proposed that the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee (FTIC),  which  oversees  matters  related  to  fair  tenancy  for retail  premises  in  Singapore,  should  issue  guidelines  on  annual  rent increases for commercial properties. This would be similar to how the National Wage Council issues guidelines on wage increases.

Rent is a major cost component for businesses, especially those in the retail and F&amp;B sectors. Excessive rent increases can impact the viability of  small  businesses  and  lead  to  a  rise  in  the  general  cost  of  living. Issuing national guidelines for annual rent increases would help to set landlords'  expectations,  and  help  tenants  in  negotiating  for  more moderate  rent  increases.  It  will  also  ensure  that  rent  increases  align with  long-term  economic  growth  and  do  not  undermine  Singapore's social and economic development.

## (6)  Setting  the  rent  of  hawker  stalls  at  $500  or  3%  of gross revenue, instead of setting rent at the highest bid by tender

The  PSP  proposes  that  the  model  of  setting  hawker  stall  rents  by tender be replaced with a new model, where all hawker stalls will be charged  a  monthly  base  rent  of  $500  or  3%  of  gross  turnover, whichever is higher.

We  believe  that  rents  are  likely  to  be  lower  under  our  proposed model.  As  of  2023,  the  median  rent  for  non-subsidised  cooked  food stalls  at  NEA-operated  hawker  centres  was  $1,625  per  month.  Under our  proposed  model,  hawkers  will  not  pay  more  than  the  current median rent unless their turnover exceeds $54,000 per month. This will reduce operating costs for hawkers  and  help keep  food prices affordable for Singaporeans.

Additionally, lower rents for stalls in hawker centres may have a ripple effect  on  rents  in  private  coffeeshops  and  food  courts.  This  will  be especially  beneficial  for  residents  in  newer  HDB  towns  that  rely  more heavily on coffeeshops and food courts for affordable food.


## (7) Phase out Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres  and  centralise  the  management  of  all  hawker centres in Singapore under a Government agency

14 of Singapore's 121 hawker centres are Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres (SEHCs) managed by private operators.

In November 2024, the PSP proposed that SEHCs be phased out as the contracts  of  the  current  operators  expire.  The  management  of  all hawker  centres  in  Singapore  should  instead  be  taken  over  by  a  new Government  agency,  tentatively  called  Hawker  Singapore,  which  will also  be  responsible  for  the  promotion  of  hawker  culture  domestically and internationally.

Since SEHCs were introduced in 2012, we have seen multiple conflicts between hawkers and the private operators because of the high costs and onerous contractual conditions compared to other hawker centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA). As of 2023, the median rent at SEHCs is about 5% higher than the median rent at NEAoperated hawker centres. Hawkers in SEHCs must also bear the costs of offering  loyalty  discounts,  budget  meals  and  subscriptions  to  food delivery  platforms.  Such  costs  are  likely  to  be  passed  on  to  the consumer.

Hence, we propose that SEHCs should be phased out.


## (8) Government-funded food discounts for Pioneer Generation, Merdeka Generation and CHAS cardholders at all hawker centres and more CDC vouchers for lowerincome households

The PSP proposes that the Government provide discounts for Pioneer Generation,  Merdeka  Generation,  and  CHAS  cardholders  when  they purchase food at all hawker centres. These discounts can be paid for through the Pioneer or Merdeka Generation Funds.

Additionally,  we  propose  that  the  Government  provide  lower-income households with more Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers, which can be used to pay for their hawker meals. This will reduce the cost burden of food for lower-income Singaporeans.

Since  2018,  the  Ministry  of  National  Development  and  HDB  have introduced the 'budget meal' initiative. By 2026, all rental HDB coffee shops will be required to provide four to six budget meals, which are full meals that are priced affordably, as compared to the average price of meals sold at nearby eating places. Many  Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres (SEHCs) have also introduced budget meals. Such budget meals are typically funded by the hawker.

We believe that the way budget meals are currently funded places an unfair  burden  on  hawkers,  many  of  whom  are  lower-income  workers. Our  proposals  will  ensure  that  hawkers  do  not  bear  the  burden  of funding budget meals for consumers, and ensure that all Singaporeans from vulnerable groups can access affordable food, regardless of where they live in Singapore.


## (9) The Government should pay the MediShield Life and CareShield Life premiums for all Singaporeans

Healthcare is one of the largest expenses, after housing, for Singaporeans. In 2021 and 2023, the PSP proposed that the MediShield Life  and  CareShield  Life  schemes  should  be  nationalised,  and  the Government should pay the basic MediShield Life and CareShield Life premiums for all Singaporeans.

Nationalising  the  MediShield  Life  and  CareShield  Life  schemes  would guarantee all Singaporeans a minimum level of healthcare after paying the  required  deductible  for  the  year.  Those  who  wish  to  have  more health  insurance  coverage  can  buy  private  Integrated  Shield  Plans  at their own cost. There is no change from the current policy.

Although  our  proposal  would  cost  an  additional  $2  to  $3  billion  per year, it would be game-changing. MediShield Life premiums will rise by an average of 22% per policyholder by end-2028, and are expected to increase  further  with  rising  costs  and  an  ageing  population.  Our proposal  will  relieve  Singaporeans,  especially  middle-class  and  senior citizens, of the anxiety over ever-rising health insurance premiums.

## (10) Provide a cash gift to every mother upon the birth of a child to defray confinement costs

Most  mothers  in  Singapore,  regardless  of  race,  practice  confinement after  childbirth.  This  helps  the  mother  heal  physically  from  childbirth and adjust to life with a newborn, which can be very challenging and even lead to postpartum depression for some mothers. However, such confinement care can be expensive.

To  help  mothers  defray  the  costs  of  confinement  care,  the  PSP proposes a new $3,000 HealthierMother cash gift, paid to every mother upon the birth of each Singapore Citizen child.


## (11) Lower healthcare costs by centralising drug procurement for public and private health facilities

In  May  2023,  the  PSP  called  on  the  Government  to  centralise  drug procurement  across  all  public  and  private  medical  institutions  and distribute drugs to public and private health facilities on a not-for-profit basis.  We  believe  that  this  will  maximise  our  bargaining  power  as  a small  nation  with  big  pharmaceutical  companies  and  improve  our chances of reducing the overall cost of drugs.

Currently,  drug  procurement  is  only  centralised  for  Singapore's  three public  healthcare  clusters.  Consequently,  private  clinics  generally  pay more for drugs compared to the public healthcare clusters, which can negotiate better prices with their greater bargaining power. This drives up other costs. For example, insurers must charge higher premiums to cover higher drug prices.

With  rising  inflation,  it  is  important  for  us  to  contain  drug  costs.  A nationwide centralised drug procurement system should be considered as it will help to reduce costs throughout the entire healthcare system.

These are the proposals that the PSP has pushed in Parliament since 2020. If we are voted into Parliament, we will continue to push for more measures to contain the rising cost of living.


## HOUSING

After  the  Asian  Financial  Crisis  in  1997,  HDB  was  left  with  31,000 unsold flats  that  took  more  than  five  years  to  sell.  To  prevent  this from  happening  again,  HDB  replaced  the  Registration  for  Flats System with the current Build-to-Order (BTO) system in 2002.

While the BTO system has allowed HDB to build according to real demand, the experience of the last 20 years has shown that the BTO system  has  one  main  flaw.  It  has  long  waiting  times  because  flat applicants have to get a successful queue number first, then wait out the full construction period of a flat. Flat buyers who cannot or do not wish to wait for a flat can only turn to the resale market. This has driven  demand  for  resale  flats,  and  is  a  big  contributor  to  rising resale flat prices.

Even though the prices of BTO flats have been delinked from the prices of resale flats in an attempt to maintain housing affordability, it is impossible to suppress the prices of BTO flats indefinitely. HDB has to pay into the Past Reserves the full market value of land ('land cost')  that  it  acquires  from  the  Government  to  develop  new  BTO flats, Land cost accounts for almost 60% of the total cost of building HDB flats, and this will increase as resale flat prices rise.

Even though resale flat prices are rising, the Government keeps the prices of BTO flats affordable by selling them below market prices and offering buyers additional HDB grants to further lower prices. In doing so, HDB makes a loss, which must be covered by a grant from the  Government.  As  the  gap  between  BTO  and  resale  flat  prices widens, HDB will make bigger losses if it keeps BTO prices stable. The Government must then provide HDB with an increasingly larger grant from the Budget, which is paid for either by raising taxes or cutting spending in other areas.

We are  thus  trapped  in  this  cycle:  land  prices  rise,  HDB  provides more  subsidies,  the  Government's  grant  to  HDB  becomes  larger, and taxes must be increased or spending cut elsewhere to foot the bill for rising housing subsidies.

The PSP believes that this system is neither desirable nor sustainable.

Singaporeans' hopes and dreams also have changed over the years. Younger Singaporeans are getting married later, or not at all. Many desire to live independently and build their own lives, even before marriage. The long waiting times for a BTO flat are also a stumbling block for those who want to have children. Changes to our public housing policies are sorely needed to meet the changing aspirations of Singaporeans.

Another major housing concern among Singaporeans is lease decay. This is especially concerning for those living in older flats with fewer years left on the lease. The value of HDB flats may fall as the number of years left on the lease decreases, especially towards the tail-end of the lease. The flat will have zero value at the end of the lease, at which point the lessee of the HDB flat would have to find a new flat at their own cost.

For many Singaporeans, the HDB flat that they live in is their largest financial asset. The potential decrease in the value of HDB flats due to lease decay is likely to have serious implications on the financial well-being and retirement plans of many Singaporeans.

The PAP Government has proposed the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) to cope with the lease decay issue. However,  it  has  not  announced  any  details,  except  to  make  clear that (1) VERS is not meant to extend diminishing leases for free to 99  years,  (2)  the  compensation  terms  for  VERS  will  not  be  as generous  as  for  the  Selective  En-bloc  Redevelopment  Scheme (SERS), and (3) there are no replacement flats.

In  January  2023  and  February  2025,  the  PSP  called  on  the  PAP Government  to  release  details  on  VERS  to  provide  Singaporeans with  certainty  on  the  lease  decay  issue.  However,  no  details  have been released.  We  will  continue  to  press  the  PAP  Government  to release details on VERS as soon as possible.

We  believe  that  our  public  housing  policies  need  a  fundamental rethink,  rather  than  quick  fixes  and  adjustments  to  policies.  HDB must urgently return to its roots of providing affordable housing for the people, so that Singapore remains a home for all Singaporeans.

## (1)  Affordable  Homes  Scheme:  Allow  Singaporeans  to buy new flats without land cost unless they sell the flats on the resale market

The PSP proposes that we should replace the existing Build-to-Order (BTO) scheme with the Affordable Homes Scheme (AHS).

The AHS will return both HDB and CPF to their original purposes. It is designed to ensure the following:

- Singaporeans will always have access to an affordable HDB flat that  they  can  call  home  for  the  rest  of  their  lives  without jeopardising their retirement.
- Prices of existing flats on the resale market will remain stable.

The PSP believes that owner-occupied public housing is a public good that  should  be  treated  as  essential  public  infrastructure,  like  schools and hospitals, where land costs are not charged because it is treated as State Land.

Under the AHS, HDB will no longer pay the land cost used for BTOs into the Past Reserves.

Instead, HDB will sell new flats to Singaporeans for owner-occupation on a 99-year lease at a 'user price', equal to the construction cost of the flats + a premium determined by the location of the flats, so that flats in different areas will not be priced the same.

Under this system, buyers of AHS flats will not have to pay land cost.

Buyers  of  AHS  flats  will  be  able  to  live  in  these  flats  and  pass  them down to their  descendents  based  on  HDB  inheritance  rules.  Because the  'user  price'  of  AHS  flats  will  be  much  lower  than  the  price  of existing BTO flats, Singaporeans will be able to purchase a flat without depleting their CPF  savings, which can then be used for their retirement.

The  AHS  will  sever  the  link  between  housing  prices  and  retirement. Singaporeans will no longer need to worry about flipping their flats or downgrading  to  afford  their  retirement.  The  AHS  flat  can  be  their forever home while they build up their retirement savings in their CPF accounts.

AHS flats can only be sold on the resale market if the land cost that was not charged is repaid to HDB.

The  PSP  believes  that  it  is  of  utmost  importance  to  moderate  rising HDB prices. The AHS will allow future generations of Singaporeans to own  their  own  homes  without  being  burdened  by  large  mortgages. This  will  in  turn  have  positive  effects  on  our  Total  Fertility  Rate, retirement adequacy, the mental well-being of Singaporeans, and the overall quality of life in Singapore.

The AHS will not cause a crash in the resale market for several reasons.

First, the supply of AHS flats will be the same as the supply of BTO flats today, or about 20,000 flats per year, out of more than 1 million flats. Even after five years, AHS flats will make up less than 10% of the total HDB flat supply.

Second, AHS flat owners will have to repay the land cost that was not charged when they sell their AHS flats on the resale market. This makes it unlikely that AHS flat owners will sell their flats unless the price is high enough to earn a profit after repaying the land cost. This will support the resale flat market.

Finally,  the  resale  flat  market  will  be  underpinned  by  a  large  pool  of demand from buyers who are ineligible for BTO flats, buyers who want to  live  in  a  specific  location  because  they  want  to  live  near  their parents,  Permanent  Resident  households,  and  buyers  who  want  to upgrade to a larger flat.

The AHS will not deplete any financial assets previously accumulated in the Past Reserves. Instead, financial assets in the Past Reserves will be accumulated at a slower rate. Today, all the State Land used by HDB is converted into financial assets when HDB pays land cost into the Past Reserves.  This  will  no  longer  be  the  case  under  the  AHS.  However, some of the land cost will be recovered when some of the AHS flats are eventually sold on the resale market

The Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) will also increase at a slower rate. However, this is mitigated by the fact that the Government will no longer need to provide a large grant to HDB each year out of the Budget, as HDB will no longer need to provide as many grants to reduce flat  prices  for  buyers  or  pay  land  cost  into  the  Past  Reserves. Thus,  we  believe  that  the  fiscal  impact  on  the  Government's  annual Budget will be neutral.

We believe that slowing down the rate of increase of the NIRC and the financial assets in the Past Reserves are necessary trade-offs to ensure that  Singaporeans  will  always  have  access  to  an  affordable  HDB  flat that they can call home for the rest of their lives without jeopardising their retirement. As a nation, we can and should do this.

## (2) Allow singles to purchase BTO flats (up to 3-room in all estates) and resale flats at age 28

The PSP proposes that all Singaporeans aged 28 and above be allowed to purchase 2- and 3-room BTO flats, and resale flats of all types, in all estates.

Currently, singles are only allowed to purchase resale flats and 2-room Flexi BTO flats at age 35. Our proposed change in policy will provide younger  Singaporeans  with  more  housing  choices,  as  well  as  the opportunity to own their own homes and start their families earlier.

## (3)  Build  more  flats  based  on  forecasted  demand  and reduce waiting times for new flats

The PSP proposes that HDB build more flats ahead of demand, so that waiting times for new flats can be reduced. This is to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of flats to implement our changes.

HDB can forecast the projected demand for flats based on factors such as  the  marriage  rate,  birth  rate,  and  the  growth  rate  of  new  citizens, and  adjust  the  level  of  new  flat  construction  to  meet  these  needs. Unused state properties, such as former schools, can also be prioritised for redevelopment into new BTO flats.

## (4) Set  up  Millennial  Apartments  Scheme  to  provide greater housing flexibility for young Singaporeans

The  PSP  proposes  to  set  up  a  Millennial  Apartments  Scheme,  where HDB  will  provide  affordable,  high-quality  rental  apartments  in  the Central Business District (CBD) and mature estates for young couples or singles to rent on leases of 2-5 years.

The PSP recognises young Singaporeans' views that the current BTO system forces Singaporeans to decide the direction of the rest of their lives in their 20s. Not everyone is lucky enough to know what they want in  their  20s.  As  society evolves, there is also a growing desire among younger  Singaporeans  to  establish  independent  lives.  The  Millennial Apartments Scheme will meet these needs.

The  Millennial  Apartments  Scheme  will  also  relieve  the  pressure  on couples to rush to secure a flat and provide young Singaporeans with more  choices  to  fulfil  their  aspirations.  It  will  provide  medium-term housing stability for young Singaporeans while they decide on their life plans and longer-term housing needs.

## JOBS AND WAGES

The PSP believes that in order to achieve greater economic success, Singapore will always need the right foreign talents to complement our Singaporean Core and work in Singapore with Singaporeans for mutual benefit.  We  have  never,  and  will  never,  argue  for  a  closed Singapore.

However, our policies towards foreign workers need to be recalibrated to ensure that our economy always serves Singaporeans' interests. With an ageing population, foreign workers make up about 39% of our workforce (including Migrant Domestic Workers) as of Dec 2024. This impacts workers at all income levels. Lower-wage  workers  must  compete  with  migrant  workers  from lower-cost countries. Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians  (PMETs)  face  competition  from  Employment  Pass  (EP) holders. We must ensure that the entry of such foreign workers do not  depress  wages  for  Singaporeans  or  lead  to  other  undesirable outcomes such as underemployment for Singaporeans.

Besides ensuring that there are sufficient jobs for Singaporeans, we want  to  ensure  that  these  jobs  are  of  good  quality  and  that Singaporeans can achieve better work-life balance. Many Singaporean workers are overworked, sleep-deprived, and burnt out amid  a  punishing  work  culture.  More  than  90%  of  employees  in Singapore  reported  working  beyond  official  working  hours,  and surveys have found that Singapore has some of the longest working hours per week in the Asia-Pacific region. There is an urgent need for the Government to push forward more policies to ensure worklife balance for Singaporean workers.

In  this  section,  PSP  will  lay  out  our  proposals  to  recalibrate  our policies towards  foreign manpower  and  improve  the  work-life balance of Singaporean workers.

## (1)  Implement  a  Minimum  Living  Wage  of  $2,250  per month

The PSP proposes a Minimum Living Wage of $2,250 per month for all resident  Singaporean  workers.  After  CPF  contributions,  workers  will enjoy a take-home salary of $1,800 per month.

We  believe  that  a  Minimum  Living  Wage  of  $2,250  per  month  will provide workers with more clarity in making personal financial plans for themselves and their families. This figure is based on a 2019 Minimum Income Standard study on what older households need to meet their basic needs. Such a living wage benchmark will also set the standard for a fair salary in Singapore for both employers and employees.

We further believe that a Minimum Living Wage of $2,250 per month will also enable all workers to meet their basic living needs with dignity. There  are  many  lower-income  Singaporeans  who  cannot  make  ends meet without relying on Government subsidies in many aspects of life and a patchwork of social support schemes.

A Minimum Living Wage of $2,250 per month would mean that lowerincome Singaporeans will not have to rely on various schemes such as the Workfare Income Supplement, GST Voucher, U-Save rebates, CDC Vouchers,  and  Progressive  Wage  Credits  in  order  to  survive.  We believe that this is the right thing to do for Singapore and Singaporean workers.

## (2) Strengthen  the  Fair  Consideration  Framework  to provide greater job priority for Singaporeans

Under  the  existing  Fair  Consideration  Framework  (FCF),  employers submitting Employment Pass (EP) applications must first advertise the job on MyCareersFuture for at least 14 consecutive days to allow job seekers to view and apply for the vacancy before they can submit an EP application.

The  PSP  believes  that  this  does  not  provide  sufficient  protections  to ensure  that  Singaporean  workers  are  given  priority  for  job  positions that are eligible for EPs.

Thus, we propose that the FCF be strengthened by (1) lengthening the job advertisement process, (2) increasing the number of advertisements required,  and  (3)  requiring  employers  to  show  evidence  that  they cannot find a suitable Singaporean worker for the position even after completing the recruitment process.

This  will  ensure  that  Singaporean  workers  are  given  priority  for  job positions that are eligible for EPs.

## (3)  Introduce  an  Employment Pass (EP) quota on a percompany basis with higher quotas for SMEs

The  PSP  proposes  that  quotas  for  Employment  Pass  (EP)  holders  be introduced on a per-company basis. The EP quotas should differ based on the size of the company, with smaller companies being allowed to hire a larger proportion of their workforce on EPs.

Currently, no quotas are set for EP holders. The Government believes that setting such quotas would send the wrong signal that we are not welcoming to global talent, for which there is fierce  competition  and worldwide shortages in areas such as technology and digital skills.

We believe that we can still be welcoming to global talent even with quotas  for  highly-skilled  workers.  It  is  important  to  introduce  an  EP quota to level the playing field between our small population and the huge global talent pool of skilled workers who are competing for the same  well-paying  skilled  jobs  in  Singapore.  Even  with  EP  quotas, companies  are  still  able  to  access  a  global  talent  pool,  and  hire qualified and skilled foreign workers.

Additionally,  we  recognise  that  many  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises (SMEs) face difficulties in accessing the skilled foreign manpower that they  need.  To  support  the  growth  of  SMEs  and  enable  them  to  hire sufficient  skilled  foreign  manpower  for  their  business  needs,  we  will provide  them  with  higher  quotas  for  EP  holders.  However,  these additional quotas will only apply to bona fide SMEs. They will not apply to  employers  of  record,  third-party  organisations,  or  contractors  that act as the legal employer for a company's employees.

## (4) Introduce an EP levy of $1,200 per month

The PSP proposes a new levy of $1,200 per month on EP holders.

Such a levy will further level the playing field between Singaporean and foreign professional, manager, executive and technician (PMET) employees.  It  is  necessary  to  impose  a  levy  on  EP  holders  because employers  do  not  have  to  pay  the  17%  CPF  contribution  for  foreign workers. This allows employers to hire foreign EP holders at the same basic  monthly  salary  as  a  Singaporean  worker  but  at  a  lower  overall wage bill.

A  levy  on  EP  holders  will  ensure  that  employers  do  not  enjoy  any financial benefits from employing EP holders instead of Singaporeans.

## (5) Increase EP qualifying salary to $10,000

As  of  1  January  2025,  the  Minimum  Qualifying  Salary  (MQS)  for  EP holders starts at $5,600 per month and reaches $10,700 for EP holders aged 45 and above.

The  PSP  proposes  that  the  MQS  for  all  EP  holders  be  increased  to $10,000 per month.

## (6)  Limit  the  concentration of work pass holders from a single nationality for every company to minimise the risk of discriminatory practices at the workplace

The PSP proposes that the Government impose diversity quotas on a per-company basis (i.e. limits on the total percentage of a company's workforce from a single foreign nationality).

Such  a  policy  would  be  a  stronger  safeguard  than  COMPASS  in ensuring  that  our  workplaces  remain  diverse,  and  do  not  become communal enclaves dominated by a single foreign nationality.

## (7) Retrenched employees should not be bound by noncompete clauses

The  PSP  calls  on  the  Government  to  create  a  legal  framework  to exempt  retrenched  employees  from  non-compete  clauses  after  their retrenchment.

Non-compete  clauses  (also  known  as  restraint  of  trade  clauses)  are often included in employment contracts. Such clauses typically restrict an  employee  from  working  for  a  competitor  or  starting  a  competing business for a specified period of time, or within a certain geographical area, after leaving the company.

Such clauses can create difficulties for employees who are retrenched, through no fault of their own, when they seek to find a new job after retrenchment. It is unfair to the employee if they are forced to find a new job due to a business decision made by the company and yet are further restricted in their job options due to non-compete clauses.

## (8) Create statutory retrenchment  benefits that are legally binding

The  PSP  calls  on  the  Government  to  work  with  tripartite  partners  to entrench retrenchment benefits into law.

The Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment states that employees with 2 years' service or more are eligible for retrenchment benefit, while those with less than 2 years' service could be granted an ex-gratia payment. However, the Advisory is not legally binding and does not have the force of law.

The  Advisory  also  states  that  the  quantum  of  retrenchment  benefit depends  on  the  collective  agreement  or  contract  of  service.  In  the absence of such an agreement or provision, the prevailing norm is to pay  a  retrenchment  benefit  varying  between  2  weeks  to  one  month salary,  per  year  of  service,  depending  on  the  financial  position  of  the company and taking into consideration industry norms.

The PSP believes that employees with 2 years' service or more should be paid at least 2 weeks' salary per year of service, by law. To reduce the  burden  on  companies,  we  could  consider  exempting  smaller companies  with  fewer  employees  and  companies  that  are  entering receivership or declaring bankruptcy from these provisions.

We  believe that statutory retrenchment benefits will strengthen protections  for  employees  and  ensure  that  retrenchments  are  truly intended as a cost-saving measure of last resort.

## (9) Equalise parental leave

From 1 April  2026,  mothers  will  enjoy  16  weeks  of  Government-paid maternity leave, fathers will enjoy 4 weeks  of Government-paid paternity  leave,  and  both  parents  will  share  10  weeks  of  Shared Parental Leave.

Parents will enjoy a total of 30 weeks of Government-paid leave to care for their infant children. A father will be entitled to a maximum of  14 weeks of Government-paid leave, while a mother will be entitled to a minimum of 16 weeks of Government-paid leave. While this is close to equal, it is not.

The PSP  repeats  our  call  for  parental  leave  to  be  shared  equally  by default,  as  illustrated  in  the  table  below.  This  will  send  a  clear  social signal that the responsibilities of parenting are shared equally between both parents, and the Government will equally support both parents in having and raising children. Under our proposal, both parents will now have 15 weeks of parental leave, unless they agree otherwise.

| Leave type                                                              | Current                                  | PSP Proposal                              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Government-paid maternity leave                                         | 16 weeks                                 | 4 weeks                                   |
| Government-paid paternity leave                                         | 4 weeks                                  | 4 weeks                                   |
| Shared Parental Leave (shared equally  between both parents by default) | 10 weeks (5 weeks per parent by default) | 22 weeks (11 weeks per parent by default) |
| Total                                                                   | 30 weeks                                 | 30 weeks                                  |

## (10) Provide greater incentives for family-friendly employers

Employers  may  face  difficulties  with  their  manpower  situation  when employees go on parental leave. This creates a potential conflict in the interest of society and the interest of employers.

The  PSP  calls  on  the  Government  to  introduce  greater  incentives  for family-friendly employers.

For example, we can tilt the balance towards family-friendly employers by providing them with relatively higher access to foreign manpower. We can lower the general S Pass or Work Permit quotas that apply to all  employers,  while  providing  additional  quotas  for  employers  with employees going on parental leave. If the total parental leave taken by the employees is 30 weeks, employers can be entitled to an additional quota for 60 weeks, to compensate them for the loss in manpower.

## (11) Provide greater incentives to encourage job-sharing

The PSP believes that we can do more to encourage job sharing and the adoption of Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) to provide greater workplace support for parents with caregiving responsibilities.

The  PSP  proposes  that  companies  be  allowed  to  claim  20%  of  the wages, paid to any flexi-time  workers  with  children,  on  the  condition that  these  monies  are  used  to  employ  more  full-time  or  flexi-time workers, from the Government.

We hope that this will incentivise more employers to create flexi-time roles and  help  workers  to  better  balance  their  work  and  family commitments.

## (12) Reduce statutory working hours from 44 hours to 40 hours per week

The PSP calls for the statutory number of working hours to be reduced from 44 hours per week to 40 hours per week to better support worklife balance and allow lower-wage workers to be entitled to more hours that are paid at the overtime rate.

Currently,  the  statutory  number  of  working  hours  per  week  is  44,  for workers  covered  under  Part  4  of  the  Employment  Act  1968.  Such workers  include  workmen  (doing  manual  labour)  earning  a  monthly basic salary of $4,500 or less and non-workmen earning a monthly basic salary of $2,600 or less. Work in excess of 44 hours per week must be paid at the overtime rate, which is at least 1.5 times the hourly basic rate of pay.

If the statutory number of working hours is reduced, workers could be entitled to more overtime pay. For workers earning an hourly wage, the Government  should  work  with  tripartite  partners  to  ensure  that  the reduction  in  statutory  hours  does  not  result  in  a  reduction  in  the worker's overall salary. For example, if a worker was working 44 hours per week at $10 per hour, their salary should be increased to $11 per hour if their total working hours are reduced from 44 hours to 40 hours per week.

## (13) Increase minimum paid annual leave to 14 days per year for all workers

The  PSP  calls  for  the  statutory  minimum  legal  entitlement  for  paid annual  leave  to  be  increased  to  14  days  per  year  for  all  workers, regardless of the number of years of service.

In Singapore, the statutory minimum legal entitlement for paid annual leave is 7 days. This statutory entitlement increases with each year of service, up to 14 days.

As of 2023, the mean number of days of paid annual leave provided to full-time resident employees aged 25 to 64 is 12 days for those earning below $2,000 a month; 17 days for those earning between $2,000 to $4,999 per month; and 21 days for those earning $5,000 and above per month.

An increase in the minimum number of paid annual leave will especially benefit lower-wage workers, who have a lower median number of days of paid annual leave, and better support all workers in balancing their work and personal needs.

## (14) Increase number of public holidays from 11 to 14

In  1968,  in  order  to  ensure  Singapore's  economic  viability  after  the departure of the British Armed Forces, the number of public holidays was  reduced  from  16  to  11.  At  the  time,  then-Minister  for  Law  and National Development E.W. Barker said, 'if our island prospers, I am sure the Government will ask me to come back here and on that day it will  be  my  pleasure  to  move  amendments  to  increase  the  number  of holidays.'

Since 1968, our nation has indeed prospered. However, the number of public holidays still stands at 11, which is lower than many of our AsiaPacific neighbours. For example, Malaysia observes 14 federal holidays, while Japan has 16. Hong Kong will increase the number of statutory public holidays from 13 to 17 by 2030. Starting in 2025, China has also increased the number of public holidays from 11 to 13, adding Chinese New Year's Eve and an extra day off for Labour Day.

The  PSP  proposes  that  the  number  of  public  holidays  be  increased from 11 to 14, with one new holiday for each of the three major ethnic groups. The new holidays should be determined after consulting with representatives of each ethnic group and the Inter-Religious Organisation.  The  holidays  that  we  adopt  can  also  be  aligned  with other  Asia-Pacific  neighbours.  Such  holidays  could  include  Chinese New Year's Eve, the day after Hari Raya Puasa, and Thaipusam.

More public  holidays  will  benefit  all  workers  and  help  them  maintain work-life balance.

## (15) Implement the 'right to disconnect'

The PSP proposes that a 'right to disconnect' policy be progressively introduced.

With  the  rise  in  digital  communications,  it  has  become  increasingly difficult  for  employees  to  disengage  from  work.  Many  receive  workrelated  messages  and  communications  after  work  hours.  This  has increasingly blurred the line between work and life.

A 'right to disconnect' policy will provide employees with the right to refuse to monitor work-related communications outside of work hours. Such  work-related  communications  would  include  emails,  texts,  and phone  calls  from  employers,  colleagues,  and  third  parties  such  as clients and suppliers. Employers would still be allowed to communicate with employees in the case of emergencies.

Under our proposal, the 'right to disconnect' could first be introduced for employees on paid leave. This could eventually extend to the right to  disconnect  between  7pm  and  7am  or  outside  the  normal  working hours of the employee.

## SOCIAL SAFETY NET

For many years, the PAP Government has championed self-reliance instead of building a strong social safety net for Singaporeans, for fear that welfare  will reduce  Singaporeans'  incentive  to  work. However, it is important for Singapore to have a sufficiently robust social safety net so that no Singaporean is left behind even as our country progresses economically.

The PSP's founder, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, expressed such sentiments in  Parliament  as  early  as  1985.  At  the  time,  he  said,  'Running  a country is not like running a company. We cannot "sack' our people if  they  are  less  effective.  Our  responsibilities  go  beyond  that.  We must help them.' Forty years later, this is still the PSP's belief.

Since  the  2011  General  Election,  the  PAP  Government  has  taken significant  steps  to  strengthen  the  social  safety  net  in  Singapore. The elderly  now receive significant  subsidies  for  their  medical  bills with  the  Pioneer  Generation  Package  and  Merdeka  Generation Package, and MediShield Life has been available since 2014 to help all Singaporeans with hospital bills.

However,  many  gaps  still  remain.  Retirement  adequacy  remains  a worry for many working Singaporeans. Many are also concerned by the alarming rate of increase in MediShield Life and CareShield Life premiums, and the consequential impact on their retirement as they age. The system of social support schemes is complex and not easy to navigate, especially for those who need help.

In this section, PSP will present our proposals to help strengthen the social safety net for Singaporeans.

## (1)  Simplify  the  existing  multiple  overlapping  support scheme system to a few national schemes

The  PSP  calls  on  the  Government  to  simplify  the  existing  support scheme system, which has multiple overlapping support schemes, to a few national schemes that can achieve the same objectives of supporting Singaporeans who need help.

There  are  currently  about  60  support  schemes  and  services  to  help Singaporeans,  and  slightly  more  than  half  of  those  schemes  require applications.  Schemes  requiring  applications  include  the  Community Health Assist Scheme, Public Transport Voucher Scheme, and ComCare Long Term Assistance.

This results in a confusing support scheme system that is challenging to navigate. Such an approach also comes with high administrative costs because external help may be needed to navigate through the maze of eligibility rules. This is especially so for those Singaporeans who are less proficient in English, or do not have the time or energy to determine which schemes they qualify for.

## (2) Provide Government-paid  allowance for full-time caregivers of Singapore Citizen children below age 7

Full-time caregivers of young children make great unpaid contributions to society. Many parents, especially mothers, choose to sacrifice their careers  to  bring  up  their  children.  Many  grandparents  also  carry  out caregiving  duties  on  behalf  of  full-time  working  parents,  such  as bringing the grandchildren to school, minding them after school, and cooking for them.

The  PSP  proposes  that  the  Government  provide  a  $1,250  monthly allowance, including CPF contributions, to one parent or grandparent who is  the  registered  full-time  caregiver  of  a  Singapore  Citizen  child from birth until the age of 7. This would provide recognition and real and effective support for these full-time caregivers.

Households who claim this allowance would no longer be eligible for Government subsidies for full-day childcare and infant care programmes.

Under such a scheme, a 35-year-old full-time homemaker would receive $1,000 in  cash  and  $462.50  in  CPF  contributions,  while  a  75-year-old grandparent would receive $1,156 in cash and $156 in CPF contributions.

We  estimate  that even if every eligible household  claimed this allowance, this would cost no more than $2.5 billion per year.

## (3) Double Silver Support Scheme payouts

The Silver  Support  Scheme supports Singapore Citizens aged 65 and above, who had low incomes during their working years and now have less in retirement. The  scheme  currently  provides  quarterly cash payments of $215 to $1,080, equating to $72 to $360 per month.

The PSP calls for the quarterly cash payouts under the Silver Support Scheme to be doubled to $430 to $2,160 (equating to $144 to $720 per  month),  depending  on  HDB  flat  type  and  monthly  per  capita household income. This would better support recipients in living out a dignified retirement.


## (4) Ensure that Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation Funds are fully utilised

The Pioneer Generation Fund (PG Fund) and Merdeka Generation Fund (MG  Fund)  are  endowment  funds  set  aside  to  fund  the  Pioneer Generation Package and Merdeka Generation Package, respectively.

As at 31 March 2024, the estimated liabilities of the PG Fund and MG Fund  were  $6.11  billion  and  $5.78  billion  respectively.  The  fund balances of the PG Fund and MG Fund were $5.52 billion and $5.55 billion  respectively,  but  this  does  not  include  future  investment  and interest income.

The  Government  only  publishes  the  value  of  the  liabilities  of  the  PG and  MG  Funds.  It  does  not  publish  the  projected  investment  and interest income of the PG and MG Funds over their remaining lifetimes as these  are  dependent  on  the  utilisation  of  the  funds  and  the remaining fund balances.

For  transparency,  the  PSP  urges  the  Government  to  publish  the  sum total of the projected investment and interest income and current fund balances  so  that  the  public  can  compare  them  against  the  estimated liabilities of both funds.

We also call on the Government to ensure that the PG Fund and MG Fund  are  fully  utilised  over  the  lifetime  of  the  funds,  and  to  make adjustments to the Pioneer Generation Package and Merdeka Generation Package where necessary to ensure this.

## (5) Set up  the  CPF  Lifetime  Retirement  Investment Scheme

In  2016, the CPF Advisory Board recommended the introduction of a new Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS), a recommendation which  was  accepted  by  the  Government.  The  PSP  calls  on  the Government to set up the LRIS as soon as possible.

Under the LRIS, CPF members would be allowed to invest some of their CPF  savings  in  simple-to-understand,  low-fee,  well-diversified,  and professionally  managed life  cycle  investment  products.  Such  products would be passively managed and carefully selected by the CPF Board. The funds would most likely invest in higher-risk,  higher-return  assets such  as  equities  when  the  CPF  member  is  younger  and  lower-risk, lower-return assets such as bonds when they are closer to retirement age. Similar funds are offered by the Australian superannuation scheme or the 401(k) scheme in the United States.

The LRIS would be an additional option for CPF members to grow their investable CPF savings and potentially earn higher returns. According to  statistics  published  by  the  US  Department  of  Labor,  401(k)  plans returned about 6-10% per annum when the rate of return is assessed over a five-year period.

While  the  returns  each  year  will  be  much  more  volatile  than  a  fixed interest  rate  from  CPF,  it  should  be  possible  to  earn  a  higher  return through  the  Lifetime  Retirement  Investment  Scheme  over  30  or  40 years. The LRIS can also help grow Singapore's local fund management industry and reduce the number of Singaporeans that are over-invested in property.

## (6) Expand the use of MediSave

As of 2021, MediSave account holders have accumulated $118 billion in balances. However, only $1.1 billion, or less than 1%, was withdrawn for direct medical expenses that year. This is a tiny percentage which is less than the interest earned by Singaporeans each year on their MediSave balances,  and  a  decrease  from  2015  when  $905  million  or  1.2%  was withdrawn from a $76 billion balance.

Under  the  MediSave500/700  scheme,  MediSave  account  holders  are allowed to withdraw $500 per year for outpatient services to treat noncomplex conditions, or $700 per year for complex chronic conditions per annum per patient.

The PSP calls for withdrawal limits under the MediSave 500/700 scheme to be increased, given Singapore's ageing population and the increasing demand for healthcare, coupled with the fact that Singaporeans are not fully utilising the interest they earn each year on their MediSave balances for medical expenses.

The PSP also calls on the Government to expand the use of MediSave by  expanding  the  range  of  outpatient  treatments  that  are  covered under  MediSave,  such  as  basic  preventive  and  non-aesthetic  dental treatments that do not involve surgery, such as root canal treatments, crowning,  and  denturing.  Many  preventive  dental  procedures  can  be expensive and are generally not claimable under the MediSave scheme.

The Government has recognised that oral health is an integral part of overall health and wellbeing. In Budget 2025, the Government extended CHAS subsidies for basic and preventive dental procedures to  CHAS  Orange  cardholders.  Expanding  the  MediSave  scheme  to cover  preventative  dental  procedures  will  help  Singaporeans  better cope with the rising out-of-pocket costs of such treatments.

Additionally,  the  PSP  proposes  to  allow  maternity  and  child-bearing medical fees to be fully claimable from MediSave without limit, and to allow women to use MediSave for elective egg freezing procedures.

Elective  egg  freezing  procedures  provide  women  with  the  option  to preserve fertility  and their chances of having children later in life, but are  currently  very  costly  in  Singapore.  Allowing  MediSave  to  be  used for such procedures would help to defray these expenses.

## (7)  More  financial  support  for  couples  facing  fertility issues

The  Government  currently  provides  up  to  75%  in  co-funding  for couples using Assisted Reproductive Technology  (ART) at public hospitals, provided that couples must be under the age of 40 and met the clinical requirements for ART. The amount of co-funding provided is reduced  if  one  spouse  is  a  Permanent  Resident  or  a  foreigner.  Cofunding is provided for a maximum of 3 fresh and 3 frozen ART cycles. The last two co-funded cycles can be completed after age 40 as long as ART or IUI procedures have been attempted before age 40.

The  PSP  believes  that  we  can  do  more  to  support  couples  facing fertility issues given our falling fertility rates. The PSP proposes to allow all  couples  to  receive  up  to  75%  co-funding  for  assisted  conception procedures as long as one spouse is a Singapore Citizen.

Government co-funding should be provided for an unlimited number of ART cycles  for  women  under  the  age  of  40,  until  they  have  had  two children who are Singapore Citizens.

For  women  from  age  40  to  45,  Government  co-funding  should  be provided for three fresh and three frozen ART cycles.

## (8) Strengthen support for mental health services

More  can  be  done  to  strengthen  support  for  mental  health  and psychological  services.  The  PSP  proposes  to  provide  greater  financial support for those seeking help with their mental health.

Currently, patients with schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder  and  anxiety  can  withdraw  up  to  S$500  from  MediSave  each year  to  defray  the  cost  of  treatments  under  the  Chronic  Disease Management Programme (CDMP). The PSP calls for these limits to be increased to reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients, due to the high cost  of  treatments  for  mental  health  conditions,  such  as  counselling, therapy, and medications.

The Government should also officially regulate the provision of mental health services by counsellors, which is currently self-regulated. This will strengthen  protections  for  consumers  and  provide  practitioners  with greater recognition.

We  also  call  on  the  Government  to  increase  the  number  of  mental health professionals in public hospitals and reduce the waiting times for new  subsidised  appointments  with  mental  health  professionals.  The average median waiting time for such an appointment with a psychiatrist at a public hospital has increased from 27 days in 2018 to 47 in 2023, while the average median waiting time to see a psychologist at a public hospital increased from 28 days in 2018 to 36 days in 2023. This is not acceptable.

With rising  societal  pressures  and  mental  health  conditions  becoming increasingly prevalent, it is vital for the Government to improve access to mental health services in the public healthcare system.

## EDUCATION

In  many respects, Singapore's education system is the envy of the world.  Our  students  were  ranked  No.  1  for  mathematics,  science and reading in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)  2022,  a  study  conducted  by  the  Organisation  for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

However,  this  success  has  not  been  unequivocal.  Our  students spend many hours at private tuition, which also comes at great cost to their parents. Private tuition has become a billion-dollar industry, and average monthly household expenditure on private tuition has increased 19% from $88.40 in 2017/18 to $104.80 in 2023, based on the Household Expenditure Survey. Our students perform very well academically but struggle in other areas. Based on PISA's assessment, Singapore  students could do  better in resilience, maintaining  a  balance  between  school  and  leisure,  and  having  a growth mindset instead of being fearful of failure.

The PSP believes that systemic changes to our education system are required to ensure that it remains  holistic and  supportive of students.  Our  education  system  should  provide  multiple  paths  to success,  so  that  Singaporeans  can  achieve  their  fullest  potential  in whichever way suits them best.

Our education system should also be flexible enough to allow entry and exit points throughout an individual's formal educational journey,  with  SkillsFuture  coming  into  play  seamlessly  once  the individual  enters  the  workforce,  so  that  the  goal  of  self-directed lifelong learning becomes integral to Singapore's education philosophy.

Additionally, we must do more to ensure that opportunities in our education  system  remain  open  to  every  Singaporean  student, regardless of how wealthy or well-educated their parents are.

Our education system should be a social leveller, and not entrench social stratification or an elitist culture.

In  this  section,  the  PSP  will  share  our  policy  proposals  on  how  the education system can be improved to be more holistic and to better support Singaporeans in achieving their best.

## (1) Introduce a 10-year through-train programme (where taking PSLE is optional)

The PSP has repeatedly called on the Government to pilot a 10-year through-train  programme,  in  which  the  PSLE  is  optional.  Not  all students under 13 years of age respond well to the stress of high-stakes examinations, and the stress of the PSLE  is arguably not ageappropriate.

There is no one school in Singapore that can cater to all learners. The PSP proposes that a 10-year through-train programme, without PSLE, be piloted in some schools.

This pilot programme will provide students and parents with a choice: they  can  choose  to  allow  their  children  not  to  take  the  PSLE  and  go through 10 years of education in schools that support assessments that are benchmarked  against  real-life skills and  contexts, or go  the traditional  PSLE  route.  This  will  be  vastly  different  from  our  current system,  which  denies  parents  the  choice  of  not  letting  their  children take PSLE.

Furthermore,  the  10-year  through-train  programme  will  allow  us  to provide  students  with  a  more  diverse  curriculum.  This  would  include offering a wider range of subjects to students and greater flexibility in their choices and combinations.

Under  our  current  primary  school  system,  students  are  offered  nine subjects,  but  only  four  are  assessed  in  the  PSLE.  Art,  Music,  Physical Education, Social Studies, and Character and Citizenship Education are not.  Such  treatment  skews  time  and  effort  towards  the  four  core subjects that are tested at the PSLE: English Language, Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics, and Science.

A  10-year  through-train  programme  would  enable  all  subjects  to  be equally  emphasised  at  the  primary  school  level.  It  would  also  allow students  to  better  develop  themselves  in  the  arts,  humanities,  and sports,  which  are  areas  that  are  currently  not  tested  at  the  PSLE  and arguably given less attention by students and parents today.

A through-train programme does not mean that students will not have to  sit  for  any  academic  assessments.  Under  the  pilot  programme, internal school examinations will continue to provide regular academic checkpoints for students.

If, at any point before the PSLE, students or their parents feel that their needs are not being met by the through-train programme and wish to return  to  the  PSLE  track,  they  should  be  provided  with  the  option  of transferring  back  to  the  PSLE  track  at  another  school  based  on  their internal school examination results.

A  10-year  through-train  programme  would  be  a  game-changer  for students and parents. If primary school students do not have to spend many months preparing for a major examination like the PSLE, we can direct  their  energies  toward  a  more  holistic  development  and  better equip them to thrive in a more complex world.

## (2) Allow for a range of school sizes, not just big schools

Currently, MOE routinely merges schools if they begin to get too small because of falling  birth  rates  and  changing  demographics  of  housing estates. The merger and disappearance of schools results in a loss of heritage and identity for former students.

The  PSP  calls  on  the  Government  to  re-evaluate  whether  schools should be closed or merged once they get too small. We believe that our education system should have a range of schools of different sizes in tune with our learning demographics.

Under such a system, families can then choose from a variety of schools that best fit their children's profiles. Some schools could offer non-PSLE routes;  others  can  allow  neurotypical  and  neurodivergent  children  to study together.

Smaller  schools  also  have  their  benefits,  such  as  creating  a  stronger sense  of  community  and  belonging  for  students,  and  could  be  safe havens for children whose needs go unaddressed in big spaces and big class  sizes,  as  they  allow  for  deeper  connections  between  staff  and students.

## (3) Overhaul the role of assessments in education

The  PSP  calls on  the Government  to  fundamentally  rethink  and overhaul the role of assessments in the education system.

Our  educational  outcomes  are  fundamentally  linked  to  what  gets tested. And what gets tested is what gets taught to students.

The  prevalence  of  high-stakes  examinations  in  our  education  system has also resulted in Singapore students having a higher fear of failure compared to students in other countries. The 2018 PISA study found that Singaporean students are among the most afraid of failure in the world.

To enable our students to succeed in a rapidly changing and increasingly  complex  world,  we  need  to  equip  them  with  a  wideranging set of skills and aptitudes, including critical thinking, collaborative  problem-solving,  and  creativity.  Tests  and  examinations are not the best way to ensure students have these skills.

The PSP believes that  we  need  to  reduce  the  reliance  on  summative examinations  in  assessing  the  performance  of  students.  We  should increase the role of alternative assessment methods such as portfolios and  projects.  Such  alternative  assessment  methods  help  students  to acquire  the  skills needed  to  adapt  to  change  and  stay  relevant throughout their working lives, and also reduce the impact of failure.

## (4) Reduce class sizes

The  PSP  calls  for  smaller  class  sizes  in  order  to  introduce  greater opportunities for diversity and differentiated learning into our education system.

In 2023, the average class size was 33.6 in primary schools and 32.6 in secondary  schools.  As  of  2022,  there  were  about  15  students  per teacher  at  the  primary  level  and  12.5  students  per  teacher  at  the secondary level.

As  Singapore's  Total  Fertility  Rate  falls,  the  number  of  school-going children  decreases,  which  would  have  been  a  good  opportunity  to decrease  class  sizes.  Instead,  MOE  has  instead  closed  schools  and reduced teacher recruitment. The number of education officers dropped  from  36,400  in  2016  to  31,382  in  2023.  The  NIE  intake dropped  from  1,256  in  2016  to  below  600  each  year  from  2017  to 2022, before increasing to 1,204 in 2023.

The PSP also calls on the Government to create more opportunities for older teachers to be re-employed as Flexi-Adjunct Teachers. This would include re-employing teachers who may have left the Education Service for some years. This will ensure that the reduction in class sizes will not come at the expense of teachers spending more time teaching classes if there are the same number of teachers, or the quality of the teaching workforce  or  less  manpower  for  other  sectors  if  there  were  more teachers.

The Government should also look into using technology to streamline teachers'  administrative  duties  so  that  they  can  devote  more  time  to teaching students.

## (5)  Enhance  mental  health  and  well-being  for  students and teachers

In  2021  and  2024,  the  PSP  called  on  the  Government  to  implement measures  to  monitor  our  students'  mental  well-being  regularly  and systematically, in the  same  way  that  academic  achievements  and physical fitness are monitored every year. We repeat this call today.

The PSP believes that conducting a mental health assessment each year using developed tools will guide teachers in identifying students who need  help  and  allow  professionals  to  proactively  reach  out  to  them. This is especially crucial to prevent tragic incidents from occurring, as only 1.5% of students approach their school counsellors for help in each year  since  2020.  Currently,  two-thirds  of  all  schools  have  only  one trained  school  counsellor.  The  PSP  believes  that  there  should  be  a minimum of two school counsellors per school.

Teachers' mental and emotional well-being should also be a focus area. The  Government  should  implement  annual  feedback  mechanisms  for MOE teachers that are conducted by an external organisation, where explicit  questions  relating  to  workload  and  burnout,  such  as  'why would you stay' and 'why would you leave', should be asked.

## (6)  Reduce  tuition  grants  and  scholarships  to  foreign students

The  PSP  proposes  that  we  further  limit  the  access  of  international students to scholarships or tuition grants, and convert more international students to become full-fee payers, especially those who can afford to do so.

Currently, about 10% of students enrolled in Singapore's Autonomous Universities (AUs) at the undergraduate level are international students. Of  these, only about  20%  pay  full fees. The  remainder  receive scholarships or tuition grants, which require them to work in Singapore upon  graduation,  as  part  of  their  bond  obligations.  As  of  2019,  the nominal  value  of  the  scholarships  and  tuition  grants  to  the  students amounted to about $238 million.

The PSP does not advocate for a policy of zero international students at our AUs, or to send back international students. Our AUs have achieved excellent global rankings and charge tuition fees that are comparable to  that  of  universities  in  other  English-speaking  countries  such  as Australia, the UK, or the US. Therefore, the PSP believes that our AUs will  still  be  attractive  to  many  international  students,  even  if  they  are not provided with generous access to scholarships and tuition grants.

Full fee-paying  international  students  are  an  important  source  of revenue for universities  in  countries  such  as  the  UK  and  Australia.  As our AUs progress in global rankings, we should develop this source of revenue and use it to further subsidise the education of local students.

## (7) Review the number of university places for Singaporeans

The  PSP  agrees  with  the  Government  that  no  Singaporean  student should  ever  be  displaced  from  an  Institute  of  Higher  Learning  (IHL), including our Autonomous Universities (AUs), because of an international student.

We believe that a Singaporean student who can qualify for a place at one of our Autonomous Universities (AUs) should always be prioritised over a foreign student.

Additionally, even though the number of IHL places are planned with Singaporean  students  in  mind,  the  PSP  believes  that  we  should periodically review the number of AU places for Singaporean students, especially in courses such as Medicine.

We believe that our AUs should always have sufficient places to cater to demand  from  Singaporean  students,  without  compromising  on  the quality of education and the rigour of the curriculum.

## (8) Expand on non-academic-based pathways university admission

The PSP calls  for  the  expansion  of  non-academic  and  vocation-based pathways  to  university  admission.  We  recognise  that  vocational  and skills-based pathways are just as important as academic pathways, and we are encouraged to see that Singapore is recognising the value of a vocational education.

While the Government has attempted to create recognition of vocational  skill-sets  through  the  Workforce  Skills  Qualification  (WSQ) programme, the PSP does not think that this goes far enough.

We can expand the WSQ programme, such that WSQ qualifications can provide sufficient training and experience to be recognised as a valid credential  to  meet  admission  requirements  for  our  local  universities. This could be  similar to the federal vocational baccalaureate in Switzerland, which provides access to universities without the need for an entrance exam.

We believe that this will better enable Singaporeans to up-skill, even if they have not gone through the traditional academic pathways.

## GOVERNANCE

The People's Action Party has enjoyed a super-majority in Singapore's Parliament for almost 60 years. For long periods, more than 90% of the seats were occupied by PAP MPs, and there were either zero or just one or two Opposition MPs. This has enabled the PAP to amend the Constitution at will, as this only requires a twothirds majority of MPs.

This  has  led  many  Singaporeans  to  feel  that  there  is  a  lack  of sufficient checks and balances on the Government.

These perceptions are based on several facts.

For example, some state institutions which are independent in other countries,  such  as  the  Elections  Department,  report  to  the  Prime Minister  in  Singapore.  Many  laws  provide  the  Government  with sweeping  powers.  There  are  no  parliamentary  committees  that review all legislation before they are debated at Second and Third Readings.

On  top  of  these  concerns  over  transparency  and  accountability, fresh  concerns  over  competence  in  policy  execution  have  recently arisen  on  the  backs  of  costly  mistakes.  These  range  from  the outbreak of Covid-19 in migrant worker dormitories in mid-2020, the use of TraceTogether data for police investigations despite assurances to the contrary, the reversal of LTA's decision to switch to  SimplyGo  after  adverse  public  feedback,  to  the  saga  over  the unmasking of National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) numbers in December 2024.

The PSP believes that good governance requires strict adherence to our Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land that governs all other pieces of legislation in Singapore.

To ensure that  the  Constitution  cannot  be  amended  by  the  ruling party at will, we need to ensure that more than one-third of seats in Parliament  are  occupied  by  Opposition  MPs.  For  this  General Election,  this  means  that  we  need  to  elect  at  least  33  Opposition MPs.

In this section, we  put forth policy proposals to strengthen governmental  accountability  and  policy  outcomes  in  Singapore. Taken together, these changes will enhance our never-ending march to build a democratic society, based on justice and equality, which our National Pledge calls on us to do.

## (1) Reform of ministerial salaries

Ministerial  salaries  are  currently  benchmarked  to  the  incomes  of  top earners in Singapore. At the entry-level MR4  ministerial grade, ministers earn 60% of the median income of the top 1,000 Singapore Citizen  income  earners.  The  PSP  proposes  that  the  benchmark  for ministerial  salaries  be  changed  to  the  median  income  of  Singapore Citizens.

We believe that our proposal would better reflect the spirit of public service. Ministerial salaries should be benchmarked to the incomes of regular Singaporean workers, rather than an elite core of Singaporeans.

## (2) Public asset declarations for all Members of Parliament

The PSP calls for legislation to be enacted to require all Members of Parliament (MPs) to publicly declare any assets which may conflict, or may be seen to conflict, with their public duties as an MP after every General Election. This includes financial assets, non-financial assets, and company  directorships.  These  declarations  would  be  disclosed  in  a publicly  accessible  Register  of  Interests  maintained  by  Parliament, subject to some restrictions for reasons of privacy.

Such  declarations  are  already  being  done  in  other  Commonwealth jurisdictions.  For  example,  the  UK,  Australia,  and  New  Zealand  all maintain  Registers  of  Interests  where  MPs  are  required  to  publicly disclose any financial interests that are relevant to their work as MPs.

PSP's proposed reform would help to reinforce public confidence in our anti-corruption  regime  by  addressing  any  concerns  in  any  quarters about unexplained wealth or possible corruption.

## (3) Increase  accountability  for  our  Sovereign  Wealth Funds (SWFs): Temasek and GIC

The PSP proposes that representatives of Temasek and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) be subject to regular,  closed-door hearings by Members of Parliament (MPs) sitting on  one  of  the  relevant  bipartisan  Parliamentary  standing  committees, subject  to  the  Official  Secrets  Act  1935  to  protect  commerciallysensitive secrets.

Temasek  and  GIC  are  currently  managed  by  their  management  and Boards. The Government has said that it generally does not intervene in matters that should be the prerogative of the Board. For example, in 2017, the Government said: 'The important thing to understand is that Temasek  operates  as  a  commercial  entity.  So,  this  is  not  something where the Government interferes with that management.'

However, Temasek and GIC manage public monies, unlike private funds who are  accountable  to  their  shareholders.  Ultimately,  both  Temasek and  GIC  should  be  answerable  to  the  people  (through  their  elected representatives). The mechanisms for accountability for their investment outcomes should be strengthened.

Private,  closed-door  hearings  of  Temasek  and  GIC  representatives  by MPs would provide MPs with the opportunity to raise questions on the performance  of  these  two  companies  relative  to  reasonable  global benchmarks, as well as their performance on governance, risk management and ethics metrics.

For  example,  at  the  closed-door  hearings,  questions  could  be  asked about the performance of Temasek relative to US stock market indices and the Norwegian sovereign wealth funds, as well as the substantial share  of  equity  in  non-listed  companies  within  Temasek's  portfolio. Summaries of these hearings could then be published publicly.

The  PSP  further  proposes  that  the  salaries  of  senior  management  at Temasek and GIC be published  in  ranges,  in  lines  with  best  practice requirements  set  for  SGX-listed  companies.  This  will  ensure  that  our SWFs achieve the same level of transparency as SGX-listed companies.

## (4) Enact a Freedom of Information Act

The  PSP  calls  for  the  enactment  of  a  Freedom  of  Information  Act (FOIA).  Such  an  Act  can  be  found  in  other  electoral  democracies.  An FOIA would empower citizens to seek information from the Government for purposes of public policy debate, holding the government to account, or for other legitimate reasons.

Under the FOIA, the Government would be legally obliged to share the requested  information  with  the  petitioner  unless  it  can  convince  the Court  that  there  are  legitimate  reasons,  such  as  national  security,  for denying the request, in whole or in part.

Greater access to information is necessary to realise the promise of 'a democratic  society'  enshrined  in  our  National  Pledge.  A  healthy democracy cannot exist if the Government conceals information from its  citizens,  thus  depriving  them  of  the  lifeblood  for  accountability, reasoned debate and consensus formation.

## (5)  Automatically  declassify  documents  older  than  25 years

Currently, only a small percentage of documents that are older than 25 years are declassified and made available to researchers.

The  PSP  calls  for  all  documents  that  are  older  than  25  years  to  be automatically declassified unless there are legitimate reasons, such as national security. Such documents should then be made available upon request to all citizens.

## (6) Media reform

The  PSP  calls  for  reforms  to  the  media  regime  to  foster  diversity, balance and healthy competition.

SPH  Media  Trust  is  currently  being  financially supported  by  the taxpayer to the tune of $900 million over 5 years from 2022, of which $320  million was  disbursed in 2022-2023.  The  Government  also allocated  $310  million  annually  to  fund  what  it  calls  'public  service broadcasting' by MediaCorp. However, despite the injection of taxpayer funds, there is still a perception that the quality of journalism among  the  mainstream  media  has  not  improved.  For  example,  The Straits Times' 'From the Gallery' column, which provided opinions on Parliamentary proceedings, has disappeared, while commentators have noted  that  news  articles  increasingly  read  like government  press releases.

We  believe  that  quality  journalism  is  essential  to  our  national  wellbeing, and that Singaporeans are better served by a media landscape that contains more diversity and healthy competition.

To that end, we call for reforms to the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act  1974  to  remove  the  requirement  for  management  shares  to  be given to persons  approved  by  the  Minister,  while  ensuring  that broadsheet  newspapers  remain  controlled  by  Singapore  citizens  or companies controlled by Singapore citizens.

The regime for granting licences for the production and distribution of broadsheet newspapers should be substantially liberalised, while retaining restrictions on foreign funding.

The market should be the main arbiter of which print newspapers reach Singaporeans. This would be subject to oversight by a new independent press standards committee.

This independent press standards committee should be appointed and funded by Parliament, with committee members serving fixed terms of 5 years and shielded from interference from all political figures.

This independent press standards committee would handle complaints on  journalistic  reporting  accuracy,  fairness  and  ethics.  In  addition,  it would enforce a code of journalistic integrity approved by Parliament. This  code  should  include  the  clear  public  labelling  of  paid/sponsored content, as well as prohibitions against foreign interference and the use of executive  power  or  other  forms  of  non-transparent  power  to influence media reporting.

The  Broadcasting  Act  1994  should  also  be  significantly  changed  to liberalise  the  regulatory  framework  applied  to  significant  local  online news content providers in 2013.

We  should  remove  the  requirement  for  Government  approval  for company  directors  and  shareholders,  provided  these  are  Singapore citizens or companies controlled by Singapore citizens. The performance  bond  should  be  reduced  from  $50,000  to  $20,000  to encourage news content start-ups. The requirement for news content providers  to  remove  prohibited  content  within  24  hours  should  be reviewed with a view to deploy these powers in only the most serious cases  affecting,  for  example,  racial  and  religious  harmony  as  well  as national security, with all other cases handled by the independent press standards committee.

Government  grants  should  be  directed  to  proactively  nurture  new, high-quality  digital  local  home-grown  media  start-ups,  so  as  to  foster diversity and healthy competition in the media landscape. There have been examples of such local media start-ups in recent years, and they would  benefit  from  government  funding.  Various  government  bodies routinely provide such grants to start-ups across a range of industries, and it would not be new to extend them to the media industry.

## (7)  Reform  the  Protection  from  Online  Falsehoods  and Manipulation Act 2019

The PSP calls for reforms to the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (POFMA) to ensure transparency, accountability and fairness. We repeat our call that the power to declare statements as  false  and  to  order  Directions  under  POFMA  be  vested  in  the Judiciary instead of the Government, and that POFMA should be used only  in  cases  where  there  is  a  deliberate  campaign  to  perpetuate falsehoods.

While the PSP agrees that the Government should have powers to act fast  to  prevent  the  spread  of  fake  news,  we  do  not  agree  that  the Government should have the right to be an arbiter of truth and declare statements as false at the first instance without any judicial oversight, considering the fact that such powers compel the individual or entity to state that they have spread falsehoods, even if they disagree.

Prior to the enactment of POFMA, the Government had various levers to  enforce  its  right  of  reply  to  reports  published  by  the  news  media, through the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act 1974 and accreditations  for  news  journalists.  With  the  rise  of  the  internet  and social media, the Government continues to have the ability to issue a right of reply to online articles, albeit without the right to have its reply published by the same entity that issued the initial article.

The PSP's view is that post-enactment, POFMA has had a chilling effect on free speech. POFMA does not provide objective criteria explaining how a statement is determined to be false or misleading, and many are wary  of  expressing  their  views  publicly  for  fear  of  running  afoul  of POFMA.

While  unfettered  free  speech  can  be  potentially  detrimental  to  a society, any limits placed on Singaporeans' Constitutional right to free speech must be carefully calibrated to balance one's right to express one's views and the undoubted benefits of the free exchange of ideas, opinions  and  views  without  fear  of  retaliation,  censorship  or  legal sanction against the need to stop the deliberate spread of falsehoods.

The PSP's calls for reform to POFMA seeks to strike a better balance between the two.

## (8) Abolish Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs)

The PSP repeats our call that GRCs be abolished.

We  strongly  believe  in  the  need  for  multi-racial  representation  in Parliament. However, we believe that the GRC system is not the best way to achieve this. We believe that the GRC system has allowed some members to enter Parliament on the coattails of other more established or popular team members. With the increase in the percentage of MPs elected  from  GRCs  over  the  years,  Singapore's  political  development has  been  hampered  as  higher  and  higher  hurdles  have  been  set  for opposition parties.

In the 14th Parliament from 2020 to 2025, there were six vacancies that were unfilled because the Members of Parliament who resigned were elected from GRCs. No by-elections were held to fill these vacancies, because by-elections are not required where a vacancy arises in a GRC. While this prevents any individual MP in a GRC from holding the other MPs in the same GRC to ransom by resigning, it also has the effect of depriving  residents  in  these  GRCs  of  their  elected  representative  in Parliament, which is highly undesirable given our system of representative democracy.

The PSP proposed 2 possible alternatives to the GRC system in 2023:

### 1.  An  NCMP  scheme  for  minorities,  similar  to  the  current  NCMP scheme for opposition candidates.

Under  this  scheme,  all  constituencies  revert  to  being  SMCs,  and minority  candidates  will  contest  in  SMCs  just  like  other  candidates.  If not enough minority candidates are elected, minority candidates who did not win but had the highest percentage of votes can be appointed NCMPs to ensure adequate minority representation in Parliament.

### 2. A hybrid electoral system containing both elements of First-PastThe-Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation.

Under this system, each voter will have two ballots instead of one. A proportion  of  Parliamentary  seats  can  be  filled  using  the  party  list system while others can be filled using our existing FPTP system.

The  first  ballot  will  be  to  vote  for  a  candidate  in  a  local  SMC.  The candidate with the most votes is elected. We can mandate that at least 50%, 12% and 6% of each political party's candidates running in SMCs must be from the Chinese, Malay and Indian/Other communities. This would protect the multi-racial composition of Parliament with reference to Singapore's ethnic demographics.

The second ballot will be to vote for a party at the national level. Each political party will put forth a list of candidates for election. Voters vote for  their  desired  political  party.  Seats  are  then  allocated  to  each political  party  based  on  their  national  vote  share,  e.g.  a  party  that obtains 10% of the national votes will be allocated 10% of the seats.

Each party list must be multi-racial with minimum racial representation requirements for each party list (e.g. at least 50% Chinese, 12% Malay, and 6% Indian/Other).  Based  on  the  seats  allocated,  each  party  then selects the candidates on its party list to take up the seats.

## (9) Reform how electoral boundaries are determined

The PSP repeats its call for reforms to the electoral boundaries review process,  in  order  to  increase  the  transparency  and  fairness  of  the electoral boundary review process for all political parties.

The PSP  made  the  following proposals to reform the electoral boundaries review progress in 2024 :

- Requiring the formation of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) to be immediately announced; 1.
- Requiring the EBRC to publish the current number of voters in each constituency based on boundaries in the last GE upon its formation; 2.
- Requiring the EBRC to publicly and sufficiently explain all changes to electoral boundaries; 3.
- Require each MP to represent 30,000 voters, with a deviation of +/10% instead of the current +/- 30%; 4.
- Imposing a minimum time frame from finalising electoral boundaries to the General Election; 5.
- Codifying  the  membership  of  the  EBRC  into  law,  with  the  EBRC being  chaired  by  a  High  Court  Judge  and  four  other  members being the CEOs of ELD, HDB and SLA, and the Chief Statistician; 6.
- If GRCs  are  not  abolished,  to  introduce  the  concept  of major boundaries and minor boundaries . 7.

Under  the  PSP's  proposal,  major  boundaries  are  meant  to  remain unchanged for many elections. Each region bound by major boundaries could  contain  one  or  two  GRCs  and  a  few  SMCs.  These  major boundaries could take reference from existing HDB town boundaries, URA planning area boundaries and postal district boundaries.

The PSP proposes that major boundaries cannot be changed unless the changes  are  agreed  to  by  a  bipartisan  committee  comprising  equal numbers  of  representatives  from  the  ruling  party  and  other  political parties that have won at least 5% of the national vote at the previous GE. The minor boundaries of GRCs and SMCs within a major boundary can be adjusted by the EBRC to reflect population changes.

We believe  that  these  reforms  would  strengthen  our  political  system and ensure that fairer outcomes from our electoral system for all voters.

## (10) Depoliticise the People's Association

The  PSP  calls  for  the  People's  Association  (PA)  to  be  delinked  from political figures from any political party.

Grassroots Advisors should be public servants who undertake work for the PA in the same way that civil service and public service managers do for any other statutory board. Political officeholders and MPs should also be excluded from the PA Board of Management.

PA is a statutory board that manages Singapore's community clubs and grassroots organisations and works to help the elected government of the day to explain and implement key policies and programmes.

Even though the PA is politically neutral and does not conduct activities with any political party, it appoints Grassroots Advisers at the constituency level who are typically either Members of Parliament from the  ruling  party  or  candidates  from  the  ruling  party  who  lost  the election in that constituency.

The PA and its grassroots organisations (such as the Community Club Management Committees, Residents' Committees, and Citizens' Consultative Committees) do not frequently work with Opposition MPs in  their  capacity  as  MP  on  public  events  and  programs.  It  is  the appointed  Grassroots  Adviser  who  is  allowed  to  organise  community events with PA.

The  Government  makes  available  funds  to  all  town  councils for community  improvement  upgrading  projects,  but  the  use  of  these funds must be considered by the Grassroots Advisers. In constituencies held  by  the  ruling  party,  the  MP  and  the  Grassroots  Adviser  are  the same  person,  but  this  is  not  the  case  in  constituencies  held  by  the Opposition.

Such a policy helps to build political capital for the ruling party during constituency PA events and programs, as representatives of the ruling party are publicly visible.

This makes for neither fair politics nor optimal fostering of 'one united people' regardless of political affiliation.

The  removal  of  all  politicians  from  the  PA's  organisational  structure means that it  can  better  address  its  mission  of  building  social  capital devoid of any perception of politicisation.

## (11) Enact  a law  to mandate  Environmental  Impact Assessments before major development works

The  PSP  proposes  enacting  a  law  to  mandate  that  Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) be conducted prior to any land reclamation or development works on greenfield land, or in territorial waters.

Such EIAs should rigorously evaluate the impact of the proposed works on  biodiversity,  ecosystem  function,  and  carbon  emissions,  based  on the latest internationally-recognised best practices.

The full reports for such EIAs should be made publicly available (with redactions made for national security or commercial sensitivity concerns where absolutely necessary) at least 2 months before the final approval for the commencement of work is made, to allow NGOs and concerned citizens to provide feedback to the authorities as well as to allow MPs to raise questions on the proposals in Parliament where necessary.

## (12) Lower the voting age to 18

The PSP calls for the voting age to be lowered to 18.

The vast  majority  of  the  world's  electoral  democracies  set  the  voting age at 18 years. In this respect, Singapore is an outlier by setting our voting age at 21.

Furthermore, many male Singaporeans begin serving National Service at  the  age  of  18.  It  is  unacceptable  that  we  entrust  18-year-olds  with the  defence  of  Singapore,  but  not  the  right  to  vote  to  choose  their government and elected representatives.

## (13) Forming a Parliament Research Service

The PSP proposes the creation of a Parliament Research Service (PRS) to support the Parliamentary work of both Opposition and ruling party backbench  Members  of  Parliament  (MPs),  as  is  the  case  in  other democracies. Experienced researchers from other government departments and Ministries, such as the Singapore Legal Service or the Department of Statistics, could be seconded to work in the PRS.

MPs in Parliament currently  do  not  enjoy  the  support  of  a  dedicated Parliamentary research organisation to conduct research in support of their Parliamentary interventions on matters of policy.

The allowances provided to MPs for legislative and secretarial assistants are  insufficient  to  support  the  hiring  of  full-time  researchers  or  the engagement  of  third-party  vendors  for  significant  research  projects. Proper  taxpayer-funded  professional  research  support  would  benefit both ruling party backbench MPs and opposition MPs and improve the quality of debate in Parliament.

## (14) Forming  Parliamentary  Standing  Committees  to scrutinise legislation in greater detail

The  PSP  proposes  the  creation  of  permanent  bipartisan  standing committees  to  scrutinise  all  legislation.  These  committees  can  be formed  along  Ministry  lines,  with  each  committee  tasked  to  oversee Parliamentary  work  related  to  one  or  several  Ministries,  based  on overlaps of subject matter.

Such  standing committees  should  have  two  calendar months  to scrutinise legislation between First and Second Readings in Parliament, with  exceptions  made  for  Bills  that  have  the  President's  approval  for urgent passage.

These Parliamentary Standing Committees should also be empowered to  subpoena  the  testimony  of  expert  witnesses  and  seek  research support from the PSP's proposed Parliament Research Service.

This proposal  is not new.  It has been  raised  multiple  times  by Opposition  MPs  in  Parliament.  Similar  committees  can  be  found  in many other democracies, where they are seen as a vital ingredient in the legislative process.

Such reforms are required for the following reasons:

- Currently, Parliament has approximately a month to study new Bills after they have been tabled for First Reading, before the Bills are then  debated  on  at  Second  and  Third  Reading.  The  Second  and Third Readings usually occur concurrently, often in the course of a single  day,  even  for  contentious  legislation  such  as  the  Foreign Interference  (Countermeasures)  Act  2021  or  the  Protection  from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019. 1.
- MPs generally do not have the benefit of directly engaging the civil servants who drafted the Bill to delve into technical questions and concerns. These questions and concerns can only be raised to the political officeholders when the Bill is debated in Parliament at the Second or Third Reading. 2.
- MPs  are  also  not  empowered  to  subpoena  expert  witnesses  to share their inputs with them on pending legislation. 3.
- Moreover,  MPs  generally  do  not  receive  an  advance  copy  of  the Second Reading speeches that Ministers make to provide context on the legislation being debated. MPs  have  to revise their speeches  posing  questions  and  concerns  immediately  after  the Minister's Second Reading speech. 4.

## (15) The Speaker of Parliament should be non-partisan

The  PSP  repeats  our  call  that  the  Speaker  of  Parliament  be  a  nonpartisan figure.

During the debate on our Parliamentary motion filed in August 2023, the PSP argued that the Speaker should be constitutionally required to become non-partisan rather than affiliated to any party, for the duration of time that he or she is Speaker. He or she should not be prevented from becoming a Party-affiliated MP once again after serving his or her term  as  Speaker.  The  PSP's  view  is  that such  requirements  are necessary to ensure the Speaker's impartiality, and to ensure that the Speaker is seen by the public as impartial in the discharge of his or her duties.

Prior to 1970,  all Speakers  of  Parliament  had  been  non-partisan members of the legal profession, with the exception of a brief period between  1963  and  1964  when  Mr  E.W.  Barker,  a  PAP  member,  was Speaker. By having a non-partisan Speaker, we would return to earlier traditions practised before the PAP  achieved  a  supermajority in Parliament in the late 1960s.
