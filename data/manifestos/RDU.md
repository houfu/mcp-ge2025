## FIRST CLASS FAIRER SINGAPORE

"IT IS TIME FOR A NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT -ONE THAT RESTORES DIGNITY AND PRIDE TO EVERY SINGAPOREAN."

## A FAIRER SINGAPORE WITH HEART

Singapore  stands  at  a  crossroads.  Decades  of rapid  economic  growth  have  positioned  us  as  a global  city,  yet  the  fruits  of  our  progress  feel increasingly  out  of  reach  for  many.  The  dreams that  once united us-of upward mobility, tangible success, and a better life for the next generationhave faded.

We at Red Dot United (RDU) believe it is time to rebuild this social contract. We envision a Singapore where every citizen is treated as a firstclass citizen, regardless of background.

Today, many  Singaporeans  face  rising costs, stagnant wages, and growing inequality. Housing has become a financial burden, healthcare is too often  a  question  of  affordability,  and  the  social contract that held us together feels frayed.

In  its  place,  we  are  asked  to  embrace  a  new narrative. The once tangible aspirations of the 5Cs -cash, car, credit card, condominium, and country  club  memberships-have  been  replaced by  intangibles.  The  government  now  offers  us cash  handouts,  CDC  Vouchers,  CPF  top-ups, conservancy  rebates  and  CHAS  card  rebates. While these provide temporary relief, they cannot replace the pride, dignity, and stability that Singaporeans deserve.

Our manifesto introduces a new vision for Singapore,  anchored  on  five  tangible  pillars  of progress: Collective Prosperity, Citizens Dividend, Comprehensive Housing Reset, Caring  Healthcare,  and  Civil  Freedom . These are  the  new  5Cs-a  framework  for  a  Singapore where prosperity is shared, dignity is upheld, and opportunity is a promise for all.

This is not just a call for policy changes; it is a call to rethink the kind of society we want to be.

Together, we can build a Singapore where every citizen feels valued, every voice matters, and no one  is  left  behind.  Join  us  in  shaping  a  future that  works  for  all  Singaporeans-a  future  with H.E.A.R.T. at its core.

## RETHINKING OUR SINGAPORE

For Singapore to truly be a nation where opportunity is for all and not just a privileged few, we must first recognise that our social contract  is  fraying.  The  aspirations  of  the  past-the  promise  of prosperity  and  opportunity-feel  increasingly  out  of  reach  for many Singaporeans.

Today,  more  and  more  Singaporeans  are  forced  to  rely  on handouts to make ends meet. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's 'My  $1  deal'  initiative ,  which  allows  residents  to  buy  basic necessities  at  heavily  subsidised  rates,  symbolises  this  shift. While  such  schemes  offer  short-term  relief,  they  also  raise uncomfortable questions: Is this the future we want? A Singapore where dignity and pride are replaced by dependency on handouts?

Class divides are deepening. For those who are not among the ultra-rich or well-connected,  life often feels like a constant struggle.  Rising  housing  costs,  stagnating  wages,  and  growing inequality make  it  harder  for  ordinary  Singaporeans  to  feel secure. Ministers earning million-dollar salaries , living in homes far  beyond  the  reach  of  everyday  citizens,  seem  increasingly disconnected from the realities of those they serve.

## BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY

We can build a Singapore where prosperity is shared, where every  HDB  flat  owner  will  never  have  to  worry  about  their home  becoming  worth  zero  dollars  when  the  99-year  lease expires, where access to quality healthcare is not limited by income (or lack of), and where every Singaporean -regardless of background - has the dignity of a fair wage and the assurance that their livelihood is secure in a sustainable economy.

This is not just about policies; it is about rethinking the kind of society we want to be. It is time for a new social contract-one that ensures that opportunity is not a privilege for the few, but a promise to all. A Singapore where every citizen-regardless of  class-can  thrive  is  not  a  dream;  it  is  a  commitment  we must make. A fairer Singapore is one where being a first-Class citizen  is  not  reserved  for  the  super  wealthy,  but  for  every Singaporean who calls this nation home.

## OUR COMMITMENT

A NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT CENTRED ON H.E.A.R.T. FOR SINGAPORE

### Housing

Every  Singaporean  has  a  secure  home-a home that retains its value and serves as a foundation for stability and belonging.

### Equitable Healthcare

Access to quality healthcare is not limited by income, ensuring that no one skips essential care because of cost.

### Assured Prosperity

Economic  policies  work  for  the  many,  not just the privileged few, by providing fair wages, secure jobs, and opportunities for all.

### Resilient Economy

A sustainable future, where growth is aligned with protecting the environment and tackling the climate crisis.

### Transparency

A society that empowers its people through openness, accountability, and the freedom to shape their own future.

This  is  not  just  about  policies.  It  is  about rethinking the kind of society we want to be-a society built on H.E.A.R.T.: secure Homes, Equitable  healthcare,  Assured  prosperity,  a Resilient economy, and Transparency in governance.

Singapore can be a place where every citizen regardless of background-has the opportunity to thrive, where  prosperity is shared, and where no one is left behind.

## A NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT FOR SINGAPORE

Singapore  has  seen  economic  growth  and prosperity, but for whom? Despite being one of the richest countries in the world, many Singaporeans struggle  with  rising  costs,  stagnant wages, and an ever-growing class divide. Housing is getting more expensive and is perhaps the most significant  purchase  Singaporeans  will  make  in their  lifetime.  Yet,  it  will  eventually  depreciate  to zero dollars when the 99-year lease expires. This is not a distant issue-many HDB flats are nearing the end of their lease tenure, making it a pressing problem that cannot be kicked down the road.

Today, these aspirations have become unattainable  for  many,  and  the  government  has shifted its narrative on the Singapore Dream towards  intangibles.  In  their  place,  a  new  set  of 5Cs  seems  to  have  emerged:  cash  handouts, CDC Vouchers, CPF top-ups, conservancy rebates and CHAS card rebates.

The  5Cs  of  the past-cash,  car,  credit card, condominium,  and  country  club  membershipswere tangible aspirations that symbolised success and upward mobility. While not without flaws, they gave  Singaporeans  a  clear  vision  of  what  they could achieve through hard work and determination.

These new 5Cs, while providing immediate relief, lack the tangibility and hope that the original 5Cs once offered. Singaporeans cannot dream or build a future on handouts. For instance, Prime Minister Lawrence  Wong's  'My  $1  Deal'  initiative  allows residents to buy essential items like rice, oil,  and eggs at subsidised rates.

While  well-intentioned,  such  policies  raise important questions: Is this the future we want for Singapore? Should Singaporeans, once known for their entrepreneurial
spirit, now rely on handouts for basic necessities?


## IT  IS  TIME  FOR  A  NEW  SOCIAL  CONTRACT-ONE  THAT  RESTORES DIGNITY  AND  PRIDE  TO  EVERY  SINGAPOREAN,  ANCHORED  ON  A REIMAGINED SET OF 5CS FOR THE FUTURE:

COLLECTIVE PROSPERITY

CARING HEALTHCARE

CIVIL FREEDOM

CITIZENS DIVIDEND

COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING RESET

These are not just policies but the foundation of a fairer, more inclusive Singapore where every citizen is a first-class citizen, not just the ultra-rich. Red Dot United (RDU) envisions a nation where opportunity, dignity, and security are not privileges for the few but fundamental rights for all.

## COLLECTIVE PROSPERITY

Economic  growth  means  little  if  it  does  not serve  the  people.  Despite  Singapore's  4.4% GDP growth in 2024, the cost of living continues to rise,  and  inequality  has  widened. While some  sectors, particularly high-value industries  like finance,  wealth  management, and professional services, have flourished, the benefits  of  this  growth  have  not  trickled  down to  ordinary  citizens.  Traditional  employmentheavy  sectors  such  as  retail,  transport,  and accommodation  services  have  lagged  behind, leaving the working class struggling to keep up.

Government policies that are focused on relentless GDP growth have made it easier for the  ultra-rich  to  set  up  base  here,  creating  an economy that disproportionately benefits corporate  elites  and  high-net-worth  individuals rather  than  everyday  Singaporeans.  This  shift has  tilted  the  economic  playing  field,  with  the wealthiest  individuals  driving  up  housing  and healthcare costs while hoarding resources that should benefit all. Meanwhile, wage growth has stagnated,  barely  keeping  pace  with  inflation, further entrenching income inequality.

Key Issues:

Rising Cost of Living, Widening Inequality

## Rising cost of living

While inflation has shown signs of easing, the GST increase to 9% in 2024  continues  to  exert  financial pressure  on  lowerand  middleincome families. The GST Voucher scheme  provides  some  relief  but does not fully offset the increased burden,  especially  for  the  poorest households,  as  it  is time-limited and fails to account for the broader rise in living costs.

## Minimal real growth wage

Real wage growth was minimal in 2022  and  2023.  In  2024,  wage increases have barely kept up with inflation, hovering around 0.4%, while billionaires continue to benefit from tax-friendly policies that help them amass even greater wealth.

## Working class left behind

The working class is left behind. Economic insecurity is rising, and many Singaporeans struggle to afford their basic needs despite working long hours.

## OUR COMMITMENT

## Shift from GDP-focused policies

Shift from GDP-focused  policies to a Wellbeing Economy  that prioritises  fair  wages,  job  security  with  a  Citizens  First  Hiring  Policy, and sustainable growth for all, not just the elite.

## Support local businesses

Support local businesses, especially micro and small enterprises, by ensuring fairer procurement policies, tackling late payments, moderating  rents,  and  making  grants  more  accessible,  so  that  local entrepreneurs-who create jobs and drive grassroots innovation-can thrive in an economy that has increasingly prioritised large corporations and foreign investments.

## Safeguard sustainability and our planet

Safeguard Sustainability and Our Planet by taking decisive action to address  climate  challenges  and  promote  sustainable  living.  Protect Singapore's  green  spaces  and  biodiversity  by  prioritising  brownfield redevelopment and ensuring greater transparency in land-use decisions. Boost recycling rates and  embrace  circular economy principles  to  minimise  waste  and  resource  consumption.  The  current carbon tax system places an undue burden on consumers while failing to  effectively  curb  emissions.  Replace  this  system  with  enforceable emission  limits  on  high-impact  corporations  to  drive  accountability where  it  matters  most.  With  bold  initiatives  like  advancing  net  zero targets to 2035 and accelerating renewable energy adoption, we can build a climate-resilient Singapore that harmonises urban development with environmental stewardship.

## CITIZENS DIVIDEND

The world is on the brink of an economic upheaval never seen before. In the  next  decade,  1.2  billion  workers  are  expected  to  enter  the  global workforce,  competing  for  only  400  million  available  jobs.  This  means that hundreds of millions will face underemployment, be relegated to the informal  economy,  or  find  themselves  completely  out  of  work.  Such  a level  of  displacement  is  unprecedented  in  human  history  and  poses grave  challenges  to  economic  stability,  social  cohesion,  as  well  as individual livelihoods.

While  Singapore  has  enjoyed  steady  economic  growth,  these  global forces  will  inevitably  impact  our  small,  open  economy.  Rising  costs, stagnant  wages,  and  increasing  job  competition  from  abroad  threaten the financial security of everyday Singaporeans.

The  role  of  the  Singapore  government  must  be  to  protect  our  people from this seismic shift.

## Key Issues:

Rising Economic Insecurity, the Need for a Reliable Income Floor

## Massive global workforce disruptions

The unprecedented oversupply of workers worldwide will lead to intense competition  for  jobs,  which  will  drive wages down and push many workers into unstable, low-paying, or informal work.

## Mental health &amp; social stability under threat

Economic uncertainty, financial stress and job insecurity take a huge toll on mental well-being and undermine social cohesion.

## Growing inequality &amp; financial strain

Singaporeans who are in lower income brackets already struggle with financial insecurity. Without proactive measures, the income gap will widen as global economic pressures mount.

## Existing safety nets are insufficient

Temporary schemes like vouchers or rebates provide momentary relief but fail to offer the  consistent  support needed  in  the  face  of  this  historic global challenge.

## OUR COMMITMENT

## Champion the Citizens Dividend

An unconditional  cash  transfer  that  serves  as  a  financial  safety  net  for  all Singaporeans. Starting with the most vulnerable, it will progressively expand universally, ensuring a reliable income floor for everyone.

## Address the challenges of the global job crisis

The  Citizens  Dividend  provides  financial  stability  in  a  world  where  job scarcity and underemployment become the norm. It empowers individuals to seek better opportunities, reskill, and innovate without the constant stress of financial survival. It serves as a safety net for Singaporeans in an uncertain future.

## Prevent societal fractures

This  safety  net  will  reduce  poverty,  strengthen  resilience,  and  protect  the dignity of Singaporeans, ensuring no one is left behind in this unprecedented economic transition.

## Build a fairer, more resilient economy

By  distributing  wealth  more  equitably,  the  Citizens  Dividend  creates  a foundation  for  shared  prosperity,  reducing  inequality  and  fostering  a  more inclusive society.

## Opportunity for every Singaporean

The coming decade demands bold solutions to prepare Singapore for this global upheaval. The Citizens Dividend is not just a policy-it is a necessity. It  positions  Singapore  as  a  resilient  nation  that  protects  its  people  while building a future where every Singaporean can thrive in an uncertain world.

## COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING RESET

Housing is the foundation of Singapore’s social compact, yet many Singaporeans are paying top dollar for homes that will eventually depreciate to zero-dollar value when their 99-year leases expire. HDB resale prices surged 9.6% in 2024, nearly double the 4.9% increase in 2023, yet homeowners face the reality that their biggest asset will eventually become worthless. The lack of long-term security, coupled with rising prices, has made homeownership a growing  financial burden rather than a source of stability.

## Key Issues:

Lack  of  Long-Term  Security,  Rising  Housing Costs, and Limited Housing Options

## HDB flats should provide long-term security

Yet, homeowners are paying top dollar for leasehold flats  that  will  depreciate  to  zero-dollar  value  at  the end  of  their  99-year  lease.  Without  a  structured renewal  programme,  many  face  uncertainty  over their biggest asset.

## Widening affordability gap

Foreign  investment  in  high-end  property  skews  the market,  pushing  up  prices  for  locals  and  widening the affordability gap.

Housing is the foundation of Singapore's social  compact,  yet  many  Singaporeans are  paying  top  dollar  for  homes  that  will eventually depreciate to zero-dollar value when  their  99-year  leases  expire.  HDB resale prices surged 9.6% in 2024, nearly double  the  4.9%  increase  in  2023,  yet homeowners  face  the  reality  that  their biggest asset will eventually become worthless. The lack of long-term security, coupled  with rising prices, has  made homeownership a growing financial burden rather than a source of stability.

## Rising prices are making it harder for young Singaporeans to own homes

While many Singaporeans upgrade or downsize as their needs change, escalating housing costs make these  transitions  more  difficult,  especially  for  firsttime homeowners.

## A lack of housing options forces lower-income Singaporeans into rental cycles

Currently, the bottom 20% of income earners struggle  with  homeownership  as  they  have  limited pathways. Without intervention, they are locked out of property ownership, further deepening inequality.

## OUR COMMITMENT

## Champion SERS for all

Every  HDB  estate  should  be  eligible  for Selective  En  Bloc  Redevelopment  Scheme (SERS),  ensuring  older  flats  retain  value and  are  renewed  instead  of  being  left  to decay.

## Ensure sustainable price appreciation

Do so by managing HDB price growth at 35% annually  through  better  calibrated  land valuation, housing supply adjustments, and market  intervention tools to keep  public housing within reach.

## Expand public rental housing and introduce a Rent-to-Own scheme

This proposal will provide a structured pathway  to  homeownership.  This  will  cater to either the bottom 20% of income earners struggling  with  homeownership  or  young, single  Singaporeans.  By  increasing  fit-forpurpose  rental  flats,  mainly  in  brownfield sites,  we  ensure  that  these  citizens  have real housing security while minimising unnecessary land clearance.  This  proposal also helps to moderate runaway HDB prices by balancing the supply of rental and ownership-based flats.

## Prioritise Singaporean buyers over property speculators

Restricting new citizens and permanent residents  from  purchasing  resale  flats  with less  than  79  years  of  lease  remaining.  To foster inclusivity while recognising long-term contributions,  new  citizens  who  have  held Singapore  citizenship  for  10  years,  or  who have been PRs and citizens for a combined total of 10 years, should be regarded on par with natural-born citizens for housing eligibility. New  citizens  who  have  fulfilled their National Service obligations should also  be  considered  on  par,  acknowledging their tangible commitment  to  the  nation. This  ensures  that  public  housing  remains accessible to those who have demonstrated a deep, enduring dedication to Singapore as their home.

## HEALTHCARE CARING

Healthcare should be a right, not a financial burden. Yet, Singaporeans today are forced to rely too heavily on personal savings, while essential healthcare costs continue to rise. The 3M framework (MediSave, MediShield Life, and Medifund) places too much emphasis on individual responsibility rather than collective care.

## Key Issues:

Unaffordable healthcare, widening inequality

## Out-of-pocket expenses

Many  Singaporeans  struggle  with  out-of-pocket  expenses  for essential healthcare services, including mental health treatment.

## Savings over social protection

The  current  system  prioritises  savings  over  social  protection, forcing individuals to shoulder disproportionate costs.

## Skipping appointments and medications due to costs

Rising healthcare costs are forcing Singaporeans to skip specialist  appointments,  while  many  older  patients  struggle  to afford  essential  medications,  often  skipping  doses  due  to  cost. Despite talk of 'value-based healthcare' and 'co-payment responsibility,'  out-of-pocket  expenses  continue  to  rise,  making timely treatment unaffordable for many. This burden discourages early  care,  worsening  health  outcomes  and  disproportionately affecting  lower-  and  middle-income  families.  Healthcare  reform must put people before cost-controls.

## OUR COMMITMENT

## Rebalance the 3M framework

To prioritise  universal  healthcare  coverage  first,  ensuring  Medifund  serves as a primary safety net accessible to all Singaporeans. The fund should be structured  to  provide  tiered  support,  with  the  most  substantial  subsidies aimed  at  the  lowest  40%  of  income  groups.  However,  all  citizens  should have access to Medifund support, ensuring that healthcare remains affordable and inclusive across income levels. This approach not only eases the financial burden on individuals but also fosters collective responsibility, ensuring that no Singaporean delays treatment due to cost.

## Expand MediShield Life

To  cover  more  outpatient  treatments,  ensuring  comprehensive  access  to primary care, preventive screenings, and chronic disease management. This will include  coverage  for  chronic  illnesses  and  mental  health,  reducing financial barriers to care. By addressing these needs, it will reduce reliance on expensive emergency treatments and hospitalisations, making healthcare more accessible and cost-effective for all Singaporeans.

## Redesign MediSave

To  function  as  a  supplementary  fund  rather  than  the  primary  means  of financing medical costs.

## Ensure healthcare affordability

Do so by capping out-of-pocket expenses and introducing fairer subsidies.

## CIVIL FREEDOM

Singapore cannot thrive as a knowledge-based economy if it restricts critical thinking, innovation, and public discourse. Laws such as POFMA (Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act), FICA (Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act), and POHA (Protection from Harassment Act) have been used to stifle dissent and silence independent voices.

## Key Issue:

Suppressing free thought in the new economy

Excessive  legal  restrictions  hinder  the  ability  of professionals, academics, and journalists to openly discuss key national issues.

Innovation  and  entrepreneurship  thrive  in  open societies. Restricting information weakens  our ability to compete in the knowledge economy.

Transparency is critical for trust. The government cannot  demand  blind  faith  while  withholding  key information that affects public interest.

## OUR COMMITMENT

## Ensure Freedom of Information

Pass  a  Freedom  of  Information  Act (FOiA) to empower citizens with access to information. This will ensure more  transparency  and  accountability in governance.

## Revise laws like POFMA, FICA, and POHA

Ensure  that  these  laws  serve  public interest rather than political control.

## Foster  a  culture  of  transparency  and accountability

An open society is a stronger society.

## BUILDING A FAIRER SINGAPORE TOGETHER

Singapore  stands  at  a  crossroads.  In  this  pivotal moment, the choices we make will define the kind of society we leave for future generations. Red Dot United believes in a Singapore where every citizen has the opportunity to thrive, where fairness prevails,  and  where  no  one  is  left  behind.  We know the challenges are vast, but we are steadfast in  our  belief  that  by  working  together,  we  can shape  a  brighter,  greener,  more  inclusive  and more sustainable future.

This manifesto is not just a list of policies. It  is  a call to action.  It is a  vision  for a  new  social compact-one that prioritises dignity, fairness, and shared prosperity over privilege and inequity. We invite  every Singaporean to join us in turning this vision into reality.

## YOUR VOICE MATTERS

Change begins with you. If you share our vision of a Singapore with H.E.A.R.T.-where Housing, Equitable healthcare, Accessible prosperity, Resilience, and Transparency form the pillars of a fairer  nation-we  urge  you  to  take  the  next  step. Support  us  in  our  mission  to  make  Singapore  a place where every citizen is treated as first-class.

Together,  we  can  make  sure  that Singapore remains not just a city of  excellence,  but  a  home  for  all. Let's make history, hand in hand.

## THE RDU PLEDGE

We aim to build a political-social platform and not just another political party.

We pledge that we will not only be present at time of general elections, but also in the years in between them. We will work for change both at  the  Parliamentary  level,  as  well  as  on  the ground with our fellow Singaporeans to enable thought leadership and active citizen participation  in  the  decisions  and  plans  that affect our lives and the path of our nation.

We seek  process-driven  and  not  personalitycentered politics.

We want to enable and empower our citizenry to  engage  in  dialogue  and  effective  debate without  fear.  Through  this,  we  would  like  to see a people who are informed, involved and interested in policies and government.

This is how  we  believe  that Singaporean politics  and  people  can  keep  ahead  of  the changing world order and events.

## VOTE FOR THE COMPASS

The compass represents safety as those on a journey  rely  on  it  to  point  them  in  the  right direction, navigating tumultuous seas and unfamiliar  ground.  Just  as  a  compass  does, RDU  will  strive  to  consistently  point  towards the principles and values which must be present in the decision-making process of the government and country.
