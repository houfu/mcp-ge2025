# Our Manifesto, Our Promise

# A Dynamic Economy –Opportunities For All
We want a Singapore where opportunities abound, and there is pride and recognition in every job. In the past five years, we have recovered from the Covid pandemic, made incomes more equal, and enabled Singaporeans to earn more.

We will grow a dynamic economy that generates jobs and opportunities for all.

We will:

* provide more support for PMETs, and nurture more Singaporean corporate leaders
* strengthen safeguards for fair employment, including through the Workplace Fairness Act
* keep Singapore a reliable and trusted hub for business
* invest in transport and digital infrastructure to enhance our connectivity
* adopt new technologies faster, including Artificial Intelligence, to stay ahead of the competition
* secure clean energy for the future, including exploring nuclear power

We will support businesses, especially SMEs, to restructure and grow.

We will:

* ease cost pressures through tax rebates and measures like the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme
* enable businesses to upgrade and raise their productivity
* make it easier for businesses to access manpower and capital
* help companies expand into new markets

# More Pathways – More Fulfilled Dreams

Our education system is robust. Still, intense competition can lead to pressure and stress. Hence our major changes to focus on the joy of learning and to help every child discover and develop their strengths. We have replaced streaming with subject-based banding, and revamped the PSLE scoring system and the Gifted Education Programme.

We will continue to reform and reshape education so that we can all become the best versions of ourselves.

We will:

* broaden definitions of success
* customise education for diverse abilities and interests
* invest in our teachers’ professional development
* partner parents, industry and the community to deliver holistic, rounded education

To cater for students with special needs we will:

* build four new Special Education (SPED) schools by 2030
* establish more early intervention centres for children with developmental needs
* extend the Development Support-Learning Support Programme to more pre-schools
* Beyond schools, we are investing significantly in every adult Singaporean through SkillsFuture.

We will do more to:

* empower Singaporeans to reskill and upskill, and advance in their careers
* help companies redesign jobs and invest in worker training
* help Singaporeans who have lost their jobs to bounce back with the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support Scheme

# For Every Singaporean – The Support That You Need

Like many other countries, Singapore faces cost pressures, driven by wars and supply chain disruptions. But we have actively shielded Singaporeans from these rising costs.

Households will receive CDC vouchers, cash payouts, utilities rebates and other support to help with your living expenses. We will support you for as long as necessary.

Parents will enjoy expanded Parental Leave, lower pre-school fees, and enhanced support for large families. We will continue to strengthen our marriage and parenthood support programmes, to provide families with children all the help they need.


To uplift and empower Singaporeans who need more support, we will:

* reinforce social safety nets, e.g. ComCare and Silver Support
* enhance Workfare for lower-wage workers and extend Progressive Wages to more sectors
* work with lower-income families individually through ComLink+, to help them build better lives
* get children from disadvantaged backgrounds off to a good start through regular pre-school attendance and higher childcare subsidies

To build a more inclusive Singapore for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), we will:

* strengthen the post-18 transition from school to work
* boost employment opportunities for PwDs
* subsidise adult disability services more generously
* pilot community living models to offer more choices for independent living

# For Seniors – Financial Security And Peace Of Mind


Seniors should enjoy their golden years with financial security and peace of mind. To support our seniors, we created the Majulah Package, and enhanced the Workfare Income Supplement and Silver Support Scheme.

We also provided matching grants to encourage you to top-up the CPF Retirement Accounts of your elderly relatives.

# More Affordable Public Housing – More Choices For Singaporeans


Every Singaporean will always have the opportunity to own a high quality, affordable home. Our building programme was set back by the Covid pandemic. But we are on track to launch 100,000 new HDB flats between 2021 and 2025, as we had promised.


To keep public housing affordable and accessible, we will:

* build more than 50,000 new flats over the next three years, equivalent to an entire Ang Mo Kio town

The new HDB classification framework – Standard, Plus and Prime BTO flats – will keep flats in choice locations within reach of more applicants. These include new housing estates at:

* Kallang-Whampoa, the first open concept “white flats” which offer flexibility for home-owners to configure their own spaces
* Bayshore, with waterfront living at East Coast Park
* Mount Pleasant, incorporating the rich heritage of the Old Police Academy

# A Vibrant City – More Sustainable Living


We have blossomed from a Garden City into a City in Nature. Now, we will make green living a way of life.

We will continue to reduce carbon emissions to reach net-zero by 2050, so as to secure a cleaner and greener Singapore for future generations.

We will expand our:

* green spaces with 25 new parks, 50km of park connectors and 13 new therapeutic gardens to enrich our interaction with nature
* blue spaces with a second marine park at Lazarus South and Kusu Reef

Artist Impression: The Long Island

We will integrate flood resilience, land reclamation and redevelopment to protect Singapore from rising sea levels, while creating beautiful waterfront living such as the Long Island and the Greater Southern Waterfront.


We will make commuting faster, greener and more seamless. To bring 8 in 10 households within a 10-minute walk from a train station, we will:

* build new Jurong Regional and Cross-Island Lines and extend existing lines
* expand and improve bus services

# Arts, Culture And Sports – Everywhere For Everyone


We have nurtured a more thriving arts scene, and made a modest mark on the global sporting stage. Now we will take sports, arts and culture to new heights – making them more accessible and enjoyable for all.

To encourage active living and bring sports closer to Singaporeans, we will:

* develop Kallang Alive, including a new indoor arena, and a new home for Team Singapore

* offer more arts apprenticeships and scholarships

* establish a new Museum of Design

# A More United Team – A Stronger Singapore


Unity is Singapore’s greatest strength. Without unity, we would not have come this far. In a turbulent world, it is more important than ever to stand together as one people, ready to confront any challenge and build a brighter future for all.

To strengthen our cohesiveness, we will:

* build our Singaporean identity
* uphold our multi-racial and multi-religious society
* enhance integration efforts
* keep Singapore an oasis of peace and harmony

We will build a society where:

We will refresh our social compact and do more with, and for, each other. We will:

* nurture a stronger culture of giving
* connect donors and volunteers to those in need
* increase avenues for civic participation
* strengthen the partnership between people and government

# PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT

Between 2020 – 2025 we grappled with unprecedented challenges and many difficult issues as a people and a nation.

The PAP worked with Singaporeans to tackle these head on.
Together we overcame a pandemic, battled inflation, revived our economy and refreshed our social compact.

We could do this because of the trust between the PAP and Singaporeans.
Here’s a look back on what we have accomplished together.

# We Overcame a Global Crisis and Emerged Stronger

The last electoral term began at the height of Covid-19.

We acted quickly to save our lives, our jobs and our future. We:

* secured early access to vaccines
* provided free medical treatment for Covid-19
* protected healthcare workers
* extended strong social support through the Care and Support Package
* pivoted to online teaching so our children could continue learning
* connected digitally to lift spirits and morale

We kept the economy going. We:

* kept air and sea ports open so that critical supplies could continue flowing
* saved jobs and livelihoods through the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and Self-Employed Persons Income Relief Scheme (SIRS)
* initiated financing schemes to keep businesses afloat
* supported the arts

After the Circuit Breaker, we:

* proactively matched jobs and upgraded skills with the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package
* incentivised hiring with the Jobs Growth Incentive
* boosted hard hit sectors like travel, tourism, taxis and private hire transport

We deployed $80 billion to combat the pandemic, of which $40 billion was from the Reserves.  The PAP’s careful stewardship of our Reserves over many years allowed us to weather the crisis without needing to borrow and burden our children and grandchildren with debt.

Singapore returned to DORSCON Green in February 2023 with one of the world’s lowest Covid-19 mortality rates.

Together, we emerged stronger.


# WE GREW The Economy

We turned the economy around. During the pandemic, growth was negative. Since then, we have recovered strongly. In 2024:

* the economy grew by 4.4%
* CPI inflation eased to 2.4%
* wages increased: real incomes rose by 3.4% above inflation
* income inequality (after government and taxes) is at its lowest since 2000

We introduced the COMPASS framework to ensure Singaporeans have fair access to employment opportunities.

# WE GAVE Extensive Help for Cost of Living

We provided extensive support to help Singaporeans cope with the spike in inflation, caused by global supply chain disruptions and the wars in Europe and the Middle East.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) tightened monetary policy 5 times to strengthen the Singapore dollar and moderate prices of imported goods.


We had to raise the GST rate to fund healthcare for our ageing population. But we provided a $10 billion Assurance Package (AP) to offset the impact, especially for lower- and middle-income households. The AP comprised:

* Cash payments for all adult Singaporeans, with more for seniors
* CDC Vouchers for households
* U-Save
* SC & CC Rebates
* MediSave Top-ups for children and seniors

The AP provided general support for the cost of living, and effectively delayed the GST increase for Singaporeans by at least 5 years.

In addition, we provided:

* personal income tax rebates
* Edusave top ups for primary and secondary school students
* Post-Secondary Education (PSEA) Top Ups for ITE, Polytechnic and University Students
* NS LifeSG Credits for NSmen

# WE RAMPED UP Support for Families

We recognised families as the bedrock of our society. We are shaping a Singapore made Families.

# WE MADE Major Education Reforms

Between 2020 – 2025, we made major moves to reduce education stress, customise learning to students’ ability and interest, and create expanded pathways and more opportunities for our children to achieve aspirations.

In general education we:

* replaced the PSLE T-Score with wider scoring bands

# We LAUNCHED 100,000 BTO Flats and improved access to public housing

We caught up with the delays to the HDB construction schedule, which had been disrupted by the pandemic, and fulfilled our commitment to launch 100,000 new flats between 2021 – 2025.
