# Preface

Singapore is at the crossroads 60 years after our independence where our existence and survival as a Nation and One People is at stake.

On  the  surface,  Singapore  has  achieved  top  scores  in  terms  of  wealth  and income. In reality, our people have paid a very high cost in return. While we are a country with one of the highest GDP per capita, Singapore is also one of the most expensive countries to live in the world.

On top of that, we are suffering from having one of the lowest Total Fertility Rate (0.97) in the world. This is an existential threat to a country with a small indigenous citizenry of only 3 million people.

The  PAP  government  has  been  addressing  this  demographic  issue  with  a constant  injection  of  New  Citizens  into  our  population  every  year.  However such methodology will only dilute our National Identity as One People, giving rise  to  serious  social,  cultural,  economic  and  even  political  impact  on  our Nation as a whole.

In  this  Manifesto,  People's  Power  Party  (PPP)  will  address  the  various  policy issues that are affected or interlinked with PAP's aggressive Population Policy via  importing  foreign  migrants  and  labour.  In  our  view,  such  an  aggressive Population Policy is the root cause of many problems that Singaporeans are encountering  and  that  the  Policy  has  ultimately  undermined  our  overall Quality of Life.

The system of Good Governance will also be our focus in this General Election after our Nation has witnessed a host of incidents that showed a glaring lack of accountability as well as mismanagement of conflict of interests in Governance. PPP stresses that Good Governance must uphold key fundamental pillars of Integrity, Meritocracy, Accountability, Proper Separation of Powers, Proper Management of Conflict of Interests and Transparency.

# A POPULATION POLICY

## I. Low Total Fertility Rate

The  trend  of  falling  Total  Fertility  Rate  (TFR)  over  the  decades  has  been worrying for a small Nation like Singapore. The historical low of TFR at 0.97 is alarming and it signifies an existential threat to our survival as a Nation.

A Nation's existence depends not only on the size of its citizenry, but also on its shared culture, social norms as well as a common heritage. We cannot depend solely on giving out a huge number of New Citizenships year after year to solve our problems arising from the low fertility rate and ageing population.

As the TFR of new Naturalized Citizens is similar to that of our indigenous Native Citizens, an aggressive  conversion  of  foreign  migrants  into new  Naturalized  Citizens  will  only  aggravate  our demographic  issues when  the root cause of dwindling TFR is not addressed fully. PAP's shortsighted Population Growth Policy is simply kicking the can to form a bigger bomb down the road.

`The image shows a line graph titled "Total Fertility Rate Over the Years." The graph displays a significant downward trend in fertility rates from 1960 to 2025.
Starting from around 5.8 in 1960, the fertility rate drops dramatically to approximately 3.0 by 1970. The decline continues but at a slower pace through the following decades. By 1980, the rate falls to about 1.8, and it remains relatively stable with minor fluctuations between 1.8 and 1.5 through the 1990s and 2000s. The line shows a continued gradual decline from 2010 to 2025, ending at approximately 1.0.`

Total Fertility Rate Over the Years

## Why is the TFR low?

1 Late marriage due to unaffordability and/or shortage of HDB Build-To-Order (BTO) flats

2 High cost of living , which is aggravated by increases in GST and other taxes, and deteriorating Quality of Life serve as disincentives to having babies and raising more children.

3 A liberal foreign labour policy poses challenge to Singaporeans' job security, which in turn discourages them from having babies in view of financial uncertainties.


# I. Low Total Fertility Rate

## Pro-Family Policy Proposals

PPP  advocates  a  series  of  Pro-Family  policies  and  legislation  to  protect  our basic family units, enhance  the  growth  of  family  units  and  hence  our population.

## Financial Incentives

## 1) Family Kickstart Housing Programme

This provides affordable 2.5-room HDB BTO flats for young couples to motivate them  to  marry  early  before  the  age  of  30.  Further  moderation  of  HDB  BTO prices are required for young couples who earn much lesser than the National Household Median Income level.

## 2) Singaporeans First for Job Security

Singaporeans sacrificed and sowed the seeds for the fruit of success we see today.  It  is  only  right  and  fair  that  Singaporeans  are  given  the  fruit  of  their labour first. We should never be left out and treated as second- or third-class citizens in a country we help build. As such, Free Trade Agreements, namely the  Comprehensive  Economic  Cooperation  Agreement  (CECA),  should  be reviewed and amended so that Singaporeans can enjoy fair career opportunities and equal access to PMET jobs. A liberal foreign labour policy has created  job  displacement  and  demoralized  our  citizens.  Human  Resource departments of companies in Singapore should be managed by Singaporeans who are less prone to favour foreigners over locals in the hiring process.

## 3) Government Family Assurance Scheme

This is for schooling Singaporeans up to age 25 - a comprehensive assistance package  which  includes  adequate  monthly  allowances  for  families  facing sudden  temporary  or  chronic  financial  hardship.  This  should  be  considered independently from other financial assistance rendered to the family, as it aims to  provide  an  additional  layer  of  help  targeting  the  educational,  health  and growth development needs of children of families facing financial difficulties.

## 4) Monthly Allowance to Support Families with Children

For  families  earning  a  household  income  at  or  below  70%  of  the  population percentile,  each  child  should  be  entitled  to  a  monthly  allowance  of  $300 (subject to adjustment to inflation periodically) until he/she finishes mandatory secondary education. This regular payout is to ensure proper food, transport, internet access, and purchase of digital learning devices for proper nurturing of our future generation.

# Pro-Family Policy Proposals

## Family Values

## 5) Protection of Children

Protect children from materials which promote lifestyles or narratives that are contrary to the basic fundamental definition of marriage between a man and a woman. We shall not interfere with the LGBTQ community for their way of life. But for a Pro-Family society, we should prohibit the promotion of LGBTQ as a lifestyle  choice  to  our  impressionable  young  minds  under  the  pretext  of 'inclusiveness'. Furthermore, children should also be protected from exposure to the distorted narrative which supports liberal sexual relationships.

## 6) Amendment of the Constitution

PPP proposes to state unequivocally that a marriage is between a biological male and female. This will set the record straight that our survival as a Nation should hinge on the formation of our own basic family units rather than relying on the importation of foreigners.

## 7) Review of Family Laws

To discourage adultery as extramarital affairs destroy the fabric of functional family units. They  also profoundly affect the well-being and  emotional development of children in affected families.

## Birth Incentives

## 8) Subsidies to Encourage Giving Birth

For first child, prenatal care, delivery and three-year postnatal care should be heavily subsidized at 80%. The same applies to foreign spouses of Singapore citizens. This is an important state investment to incentivize procreation.

## 9) Birth by Foreign Spouse

Foreign spouses of our citizens who give birth in Singapore and their children born in Singapore will automatically become Singapore citizens.

## 10) In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Subsidies

In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) should be 90% subsidized for eligible couples under 40 years old. The remaining 10% of the cost of IVF should be fully payable by MediSave.

# II. Retirement Inadequacy - CPF, Healthcare &amp; GST

The Pioneer and Merdeka Generations have contributed tremendously to the foundation of Singapore's success. Our Nation should provide them a comfortable retirement with adequate resources.

PAP government implemented birth control programme in 1966 and started a propaganda of 'Two is Enough' campaign in 1972. Today we suffer from the devastating  consequences of  their short-sighted  policy in  having  to  cope with a fast ageing population.

The CPF  Scheme was  designed  as  a  universal  retirement  scheme  which  is supposed to be robust and adequate with high contribution rates. However, we end up with 74% of our retirees having less than $500 monthly payout from their CPF. How can it be adequate for retirees to live comfortably in this one of most expensive cities in the world? 1

CPF payout is not only inadequate for most Singaporeans, the amount is also not guaranteed for the long term under the CPF Life  rules.  Moreover,  given  the  fixed  amount of CPF  monthly  payout, any increase in indirect taxes like GST, water tax, carbon tax will  result  in  inflationary  pressure.  Retirees will be the hardest hit amid the surging cost of  living,  with  their  Quality  of  Life  adversely affected.

`The image shows a bar chart comparing two financial figures in Singapore dollars (SGD): The first bar, labeled "Payouts for 74% retirees," shows $500 SGD, represented by a light purple bar. The second bar, labeled "Minimum Household Budget," shows $1,379 SGD, represented by a dark purple bar.`

## Policy Proposals to Alleviate Elderly's Financial Burden

## 1) Adjustment of CPF Usage in Property Purchase

The  root  cause  of  inadequate  CPF  for  retirement  financing  is  due  to  the utilization of CPF in our first property purchase, which is usually for own stay. Instead CPF should only be utilized for the second property purchase, which is regarded  as  an  investment.  CPF  contribution  should  also  be  adjusted  as  a percentage of salary from the current arrangement of '17% from employer, 20% from  employee'  to  our  proposed  plan  of  '20%  from  employer,  5%  from employee'. This will lead to higher disposable income (i.e. original 20% versus our proposed 5% of salary contribution by employees to CPF) to be used for mortgage payment for the first property. To delink the first property purchase from  CPF  will  allow  more  CPF  savings  to  be  accumulated  for  retirement financing without locking our hard earned money in the first property.

## 2) Higher Investment Return from CPF

Invest the large pool of CPF in our Sovereign Wealth Fund or other accredited Trust  Funds  to  yield  a  higher  return  instead  of  being  transferred  to  the Government  via  the  special  government  bond  which  gives  only  a  fixed  and generally lower return. As CPF is a long term saving/investment scheme, such investment should generate a better yield than that of the current arrangement of a fixed interest return from government bonds.

## 3) Expansion of MediShield Life

Given the inadequacy of MediShield's coverage and increasing premiums, we should legislate to include in the scheme all foreign labour in Singapore. Under the  expanded  scheme,  all  foreign  labour  are  required  to  contribute  towards MediShield  Life  to  broaden  the  universal  healthcare  coverage  for  the  whole population.  The  addition  of  some  1.8  million  younger  working  foreigners  to MediShield Life  can  drastically  help  enlarge  the  risk  pooling  that  will  in  turn benefit our elderly who need medical insurance coverage the most. With the new  injection  of  premiums  from  foreign  workers,  MediShield  Life  can  then increase its scope of coverage without the need to charge higher premiums to our citizens.

## Policy Proposals to Alleviate Elderly's Financial Burden

## 4) MediShield Payout Mechanism

MediShield  Payout  Mechanism  is  unduly  conservative.  The  yearly  excess  of premiums  collected  over payout  is on the high side as compared  to commercial medical insurance scheme. We do not see reasonable grounds to increase MediShield Life premium by a hefty percentage, especially for retirees who live on their savings.

- 5) Lower Deductibles for MediShield Life across the board
- 6) Increase MediSave Withdrawal Limits in view of rising healthcare costs

## 7) Raise Hospital Bed To Population Ratio

Raise  the  Hospital  Bed  To  Population  Ratio  from  the  current  2.4  per  1,000 people to the OECD average of 4.3 per 1,000 people. We need a clear roadmap to achieve this ratio in the face of a rapidly ageing population.

## 8) Exemption from GST

Essential  items  and  services  such  as  fresh  food,  groceries,  water  supply, healthcare services and products should be exempted from GST.

## 9) Removal of Carbon Tax

Singapore  is  a  small  country  which  has  minimal  impact  on  global  carbon emissions. In view of the US's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, we should remove  Carbon  Tax  while  continuing  to  explore  and  encourage  usage  of alternative renewable energy.


## III. Housing &amp; CPF

HDB's price has gotten so high that it takes up the bulk of our CPF savings.

Housing  cost  is  the  most  crucial  component  of  household  expenditure because it takes up a significant portion of most people's monthly expenses, and therefore directly impacts our discretionary income and ability to save for future needs. The amount of the monthly mortgage payment is undoubtedly a key  factor  in  determining  the  overall  financial  stability  and  planning  of  any household.  Unfortunately  for  a  land-scarce  island  state  like  Singapore,  the tendency  for  land  and  housing  prices  to  be  subject  to  extraordinary  asset inflation is extremely high.

The  Land  Acquisition  Act  was  passed  in  1966,  a  year  after  Singapore  gained independence.  It  has  since  allowed  the  government  to  acquire  over  80%  of private  land  in  Singapore  for  public  development.  The  legislation  has  in  fact served  as  a  mechanism  of  fair  redistribution  of  scarce  land  resources  for residential and industrialization purposes over past generations. Together with the  usage  of  our  CPF  to  finance  our  first  property  purchase  since  1968, homeownership in Singapore has been made much easier. New HDB flats sold back  then  were  priced  very  low  because  they  did  not  include  land  cost  at market rate.

However starting from the 1980s, substantial land cost has been included in the pricing of new HDB flats. Nowadays couples in their 20s to 30s have borne a much heavier financial burden to purchase an HDB flat when compared with the good old days of their grandparents. In addition, using the bulk of our CPF to buy a more expensive HDB flat has impeded our ability to leave sufficient savings in our CPF account to finance our retirement needs.

## Policy Proposals on Housing &amp; CPF

## 1) CPF for Second Property Only

Usage of CPF should only be allowed for the purchase of a second property, which is basically for investment purposes. At the same time, CPF contribution by  employees  should  be  reduced  from  20%  to  5%  so  that  more  disposable income can be put in the  hands  of  Singaporeans  to  pay  for  their  mortgage (linked to point 1 of section II on Retirement Inadequacy).

## 2) Family Kickstart Housing Programme for Young Couples Aged Below 30

A special category of small 2.5-room HDB flats could be sold to these young couples at low prices without the inclusion of land cost at market rate, so that they can afford to get married early. These 2.5-room HDB flats could be resold in the secondary market. Non-first-time buyers or couples both aged above 30 who  purchase  the  2.5-room  HDB  flats  will  be  imposed  'supplemented  land cost'  by  the  Singapore  Land  Authority  (linked  to  point  1  of  Pro-Family  Policy Proposals under section I).

## 3) Build HDB Flats in Advance of Demand

HDB flats should be built in advance of demand to address the issue of lagged supply to meet demand for new homes under the current BTO system. This is a feasible proposal in view of the fact that the HDB is Singapore's sole supplier of  public  housing  and  hence  it  is  well-positioned  to  make  estimation  of  the actual demand.

## 4) Priority for Young Couples in SBF

Even if the government insists on preserving the BTO system, young couples should be given top priority in the Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise.

## 5) Enhanced Priorities

Enhanced Priorities should be given to young couples below 30 years old and those who have served National Service in the selection of new HDB flats.

## 6) Redefine Reference Point of Affordability

The  reference  point  of  affordability  for  new  HDB  flats  should  be  made  in accordance  with  the  median  starting  salaries  of  young  graduates  or  flat applicants under 30 years old. This is to ensure that young couples can afford a roof over their head, which in turn encourages them to get married and start a family early.

## 7) Prioritize Singapore Citizens' Right Over Our Scarce Land Resources

Foreign buyers (including permanent residents) of property (both private and HDB) should pay a 20% capital gains tax when selling the property at a profit. This  can  effectively  curb  excessive  speculative  property  transactions  and address the overheated demand for properties in Singapore. It is essential for the  government  to  keep  property  prices  stable  and  let  the  market  develop sustainably.  On  the  other  hand,  Additional  Buyer's  Stamp  Duty  (ABSD)  and capital  gains  tax  should  also  be  imposed  on  Singaporeans  from  their  third property purchase onward to prevent them from making use of properties as an investment tool.

# IV. Immigration Policy

## Impact on Jobs

While implementing an aggressive immigration policy, what has the government done to protect jobs for the locals?

As  Singapore  has  become  one  of  the  world's  wealthiest  countries,  it  is  a common  aspiration  among  Singaporeans  to  take  up  PMET  jobs  with  an expectation that migrant workers supplement our local workforce by undertaking  manual  work  in  sectors  such  as  food  &amp;  beverage,  construction and manufacturing. However, PAP's aggressive immigration policy has overwhelmed  our  job  market  with  foreign  labour  who  compete  with  native Singaporeans in all fields and industries, and for all types of jobs.

As one of the most highly educated and highly skilled workforce in the world, Singaporeans are competitive, talented and diligent. Nonetheless, opening up the  floodgates  to  expose  us  to  competition  from  a  huge  global  population through initiatives such as CECA has placed our citizens on an unequal playing field.  The  government  has  trumpeted  foreign  workers'  role  in  bringing  new ideas and expanding Singaporeans' horizons in the working world. But mind you,  before  our  native  workforce  can  gain  sufficient  experience  and  skills  to upgrade themselves  for  better  jobs,  they  are  already  swamped  by  the  large and cheaper supply of foreign workers. We can see many local PMETs being displaced by their foreign counterparts, and the trend will only continue.

The supply of  foreign  labour  with  various  skillsets  is  never-ending,  especially from countries with huge populations like India and China. Our citizens will be deprived  of  career  opportunities  to  climb  the  corporate  ladder  when  these opportunities  have  already  been  grabbed  by  foreign  labour.  This  lack  of  job security will demoralise our local workforce and eventually, our country will risk losing loyalty and bonding among its demoralised citizens.

The  PAP  government  does  not  hesitate  to  label  those  who  protest  against unfair competition from foreigners as 'Xenophobic'. But are they even aware that  prioritising  Singaporeans  in  the  job  market  is  their  basic  duty  and responsibility? Does the government  see the dire need to adopt the 'Singaporeans First' principle as our rice bowls are being jeopardized?

Some argue that local job seekers struggle because they lack the skills MNCs require.  If  true,  this  suggests  either  the  government  has  given  irrelevant education and training to our citizens or that they have attracted unsuitable MNCs to invest in Singapore.

## Impact on Quality of Life

Our total population has crossed 6 million. But in this case, is the more the merrier?

If the  government  continues  on  this  path  of  aggressive  overpopulation agenda, is Singaporeans' quality of life going to be enhanced or undermined?

The PAP government has currently capped the vehicle population at around 1 million. COE prices have repeatedly hit record highs due to its limited supply. With a growing population but a fixed number of vehicles, COE prices will only spiral upward uncontrollably. The recent revelation of the government's intent to  attract  more  foreign  millionaires  and  billionaires  to  Singapore  will  only aggravate  the  middle-class  squeeze  because  they  cannot  possibly  compete with  the  wealthiest  people  in  the  world  whom  our  government  targets  to attract.

The huge number of annual issuance of New Citizenship may only make our citizenry population figures look good but it is achieved at the expense of our native Singaporeans and National Identity. The gap between the demand and supply  of  HDB  BTO  flats  will  affect  our  young  couples.  Rapid  population growth will also assert inflationary pressures on all fronts. Furthermore, if the fertility rate of our  new  citizens  is not  any  better  than  that  of  native Singaporeans, such a boost in new citizenship will only aggravate our problem of ageing population in decades to come.

The social,  cultural  and  political  impact  of  an  overwhelming  influx  of  foreign labour  and  new  citizens  cannot  be  ignored.  Emotional  attachment  to  their respective 'Motherland' is normal. However such emotional attachment may give rise to conflicts among  migrants from different countries when geopolitical  conflicts  or  contests  intensify.  The  fabric  of  our  Nation  will  be jeopardized during such critical moments.

Most importantly, we strongly oppose any planning parameters that aim for a 10  million  population for Singapore. We are an island state with limited land and  natural  resources.  The  government  should  terminate  its  unreasonably aggressive population policy that is going to challenge everyone living on this tiny  little island  and  severely  undermine  the  quality  of  life  of  all  native Singaporeans as well as New Citizens.

## Policy Proposals on Immigration

## Jobs

## 1) 'Singaporean First' Policy

The 'Singaporean First' policy should be embedded into our labour law and employment practice. The hiring function and HR departments of all mediumand large-sized companies should be run or headed by Singaporeans.

## 2) Encourage MNCs to Hire Singaporeans

MNCs should  create  at  least  60%  of  jobs  for  Singaporeans  in  order  to  enjoy incentives, tax breaks or other benefits that are funded by taxpayers' money.

## 3) Review Chapter 9 of CECA

Review Chapter 9 of CECA which the PAP government has signed with India. In addition, we  should not have similar clauses in future Free Trade Agreements  that  allow  Singaporeans'  PMET  jobs  to  be  traded  for  other benefits.

## 4) Rethink Quota System &amp; Foreign Labour Policy

The  current  quota  system  for  work  passes  and  foreign  labour  policy  is  not functioning  well  when  our  local  SMEs  complain  about  the  shortage  of manpower while our native citizens suffer from job displacement or underemployment. The situation is evident when the number of GIG workers and Private  Hire  Drivers  is  surging.  Our  job  market  situation  requires  review with a holistic approach instead of merely looking at employment data.

## Citizenships

## 5a) Tighten Issuance of New Citizenship

Population  growth  through  aggressive  immigration  policy should be halted and issuance of New Citizenship should be tightened.

- New Citizenship may only be issued to a foreigner if and only  if  they  have  worked  or  stayed  in  Singapore  for  at least  12  years,  with  at  least  5  years  as  a  Permanent Resident.

## 5b) Prioritise Foreign Spouses &amp; Foreign-born Children of Singapore Citizens

- Foreign spouses of Singapore citizens should be granted citizenship soon after they have given birth.
- Exemption from the 12-year rule mentioned above could be given to foreign spouses of citizens and children born by  foreign  spouses  of  citizens.  This  is  to  ensure  that  a family unit made up of our citizens could settle down as soon as possible.

## 6) Voting Rights for Naturalised Citizens

An  overwhelming  presence  of  foreign  workforce  and  migrants  in  Singapore carries  serious  impact  on  the  cultural,  social,  economic  and  political  fronts. Although the Ethnic Integration Policy ensures that racial enclaves do not form in  our  HDB  estates,  racial  enclaves  of  affluent  foreign  migrants  have  been forming in private residential areas. There is also an increasing trend of foreign cultural  impact  on  our  corporate  settings  whereby  Singapore's  core  values such as performance-based meritocracy and non-discriminative hiring process have been constantly challenged. We have to acknowledge such divides and the underlying danger of conflicts arisen from geopolitical tensions in future.

To  minimize  possible  foreign  influence  exerted  on  our political  arena,  we  propose  voting  rights  to  be  given  to naturalized citizens at least 5 years after they are granted Singapore  citizenship to  ensure  that  the  voting  right  is exercised only after their integration into our society.

## Others

## 7) Additional Levy on Foreign Household Buyers of Vehicles

An additional levy should be imposed on foreign household buyers of vehicles at a percentage of the COE prices. For second or third cars or subsequent cars that they purchase, a progressive additional levy at a percentage of the COE prices  should  be  imposed.  This  is  to  discourage  foreign  households  from hoarding cars. It is unfair to subject our middle class to the competition from thousands  of  millionaires  and  billionaires  from  all  over  the  world  for  limited resources like COEs.

## 8) Population Cap

In view  of Singapore's  scarce  land  resources,  we  should  cap  our  Total Population at 6.5 million. All planning parameters  of our policies and infrastructure should adhere to this target. The government fails to justify the need  for  its  aggressive  immigration  policy  which  has  already  compromised Singaporeans' quality of life.


# B. GOOD GOVERNANCE

## Good Governance

To achieve a Better Quality Life for All Singaporeans, Good Governance is an essential element. People's Power Party believes Good Governance can only be achieved through:

1 Robust debates on key policies with diversity of representation and views in Parliament as well as public discourse and narratives. This is the fundamental function of a Democracy.

2 Institutionalized Checks and Balances &amp; Separation of Five Powers of Legislative, Executive, Judiciary, Selection/Election and Impeachment.

The  underlying  basis  of  Good  Governance  should  be  embedded  in  the following four criteria :
1. Open Debate and Expression
2. Freedom of Information Access
3. Transparency
4. Accountability

What's the big deal about "checks and balances" in government?

It stops any one person or group from having too much power.

Like a referee in football?

Exactly! Without it, one side could cheat, and no one could stop them.

## Policy Proposals to Achieve Good Governance

## Institutionalized Checks &amp; Balances

## 1) Establish Ombudsman Commission (OC) &amp; Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC)

Establish  the  Ombudsman  Commission  (OC)  as  well  as  Equal  Opportunities Commission  (EOC),  which  will  be  put  under  the  purview  of  the  President's Office.  OC  will  take  up  the  role  of  an  independent  watchdog  of  public administration.  It  will  investigate  complaints  of  maladministration,  identify administrative  deficiencies  and  recommend  remedial  measures  to  improve public administration. EOC  will implement  anti-discrimination  legislation against  gender,  disability,  family  status  and  race,  aiming  to  ensure  equal opportunities for all based on individuals' abilities.

## 2) Independent Functioning of Institutions

Transfer  the  Auditor-General's  Office,  Corrupt  Practice  Investigation  Bureau, Public Service Commission and Elections Department to be under the purview of the President's Office. This is to ensure  the  independence  of  these institutions, which either hold impeachment power of officials, selection power of civil servants, or carry out  duties  related  to the  election  of political representatives, from the ruling political party so that they can perform their functions in a fair manner without fear or favour.

## 3) Investigations Conducted by Independent Committee of Inquiry (COI)

For  suspected  issues  of  potential  conflict  of  interests  or  abuse  of  position  or power by either  top  civil  servants  or  ministers,  they  should never  be  left  to 'ownself  check  ownself'.  An  independent  Committee  of  Inquiry  (COI) consisting of members  from various institutions appointed by the President should carry out investigations. The COI shall include professionals from the Auditor-General's Office, Corrupt Practice Investigation Bureau, High Court  Judge/Attorney-General's  Chambers  and  any  other  parties  whom  the President deems fit. Such practice will help ensure a corrupt-free government.

## Accountability &amp; Scrutinization

## 4) Accountability is a Key Pillar of Good Governance

Performance  issues  of  all  ministries  should  be  evaluated.  Should  major competency issues that impact severely on the public arise, e.g. constant and major  MRT  service  breakdowns,  the  President  should  be  empowered  to convene an independent Committee of Inquiry to look into and fix the issues including systemic ones.

## 5) Close Scrutinization of Mega Projects to Ensure Fiscal Prudence

Mega projects  which  involve  huge  spending  of  taxpayers'  money  should  be rigorously scrutinized by special committees formed by Members of Parliament (MPs) from different political affiliations, with the assistance of the Auditor-General.  This  is  to  ensure  fiscal  prudence,  with  spending  decisions being substantiated by thorough studies and robust justification.

## 6) Special Commission to Review Government Spending on Mega Projects

A  special  commission  should  be  set  up  by  the  President  to  review  all  the spending the government has put up for mega projects. Profligate spending of public  money  could  have  resulted  in  the  need  to  raise  GST  and  other  taxes which have actually worsened inflation and caused the cost of living to shoot through  the  roof.  Fiscal  prudence  and  responsible  spending  of  taxpayers' money should always be observed.

## Protect Our Freedom &amp; Rights Against Power Abuse

## 7) Robust Debates Essential for Policies that Encroach on People's Freedom &amp; Rights

Policies/measures  that  have  a  widespread  impact  on  the  whole  society  or might  encroach  on  people's  freedom  and  rights,  particularly  measures  that carry the risk of jeopardizing people's health and safety, should first be robustly debated  in  Parliament.  Special  public  hearings  well  represented  by  various stakeholders should be conducted when necessary. One such example is the Vaccination-differentiated  Safe  Management  Measures  (VDS),  dubbed  as 'No  Jab,  No  Job'  measure , which  was  implemented  during  the  COVID-19 pandemic.  It  was  a  draconian  rule  that  essentially  made  the  experimental COVID-19  vaccination  back  then  mandatory.  Any  measures  that  might  carry long-term  health  and  safety  impact,  which  is  irreversible  and  without  the support  of  long-term  safety  data,  should  not  be  lightly  implemented  in  the absence of sufficient checks and balances.

## 8) Medical Freedom &amp; Rights

Health and safety concerns should always be the overriding principle in policy formulation. No universal scheme involving medical treatments or procedures should be approved and enforced on people without their informed consent. The government should immediately review the recently amended provision in the Infectious Diseases Act granting the Director-General of Health the authority to mandate vaccinations with legal immunity .  All  mandates  of  a compulsory nature on our body, such as new vaccines, surgery, autopsy, etc, must be debated openly in the public before its implementation.

## 9) Excessive Powers Need to be Reviewed in Parliament

PPP  views  that  the  PAP  government  has  enacted  various  laws  in  the  past decades that have given excessive power to the police, certain Ministries as well as Ministers. These excessive powers  have  to be reviewed  in Parliament. In  particular,  enormous  powers  have  been  given  to  the  police force and even enforcement teams of various Ministries. Most importantly, we object  to  the Protection  from  Online  Falsehoods  and  Manipulation  Act (POFMA)  which  in  our  view  has  been  weaponized  against  critics , social activists and opposition politicians. The newly enacted Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act has also given too much power to the Minister for Home Affairs without adequate means of recourse.

## 10) Amend the ISA to Include More Robust Checks &amp; Balances

We  recognize  the  necessity  to  maintain  our  National  Security  with  the Internal  Security  Act  (ISA).  However,  we  propose  amending  the  ISA  to include more robust checks and balances by allowing MPs and the Justice of Peace (JP)  appointed  by  the  President  to  pay  the  detainees  regular  visits  to ensure the protection of their basic human rights. The review of the detention should be carried out with the involvement of MPs and persons appointed by the President. A full review of the ISA should be conducted with wider public consultation to ensure that the Act is kept up to date and that any possible abuses should be ruled out.

## Parliamentary Participation: The Party &amp; The People

## 11) Initiate Parliamentary Debate on Population Policy Direction

Major national policy directions should be rigorously debated openly in view of their  widespread  and  long-term  impact.  If  elected  into  Parliament, PPP will initiate a Parliamentary Debate and an in-depth public consultation on the Population  Policy  direction  in  which  the  PAP  government  has  remained obscure. How can the government devise long-term policies without a clear population target for its planning parameters? It has to be people's collective decision  because  we  and  our  future  generations  are  the  ones  to  enjoy  the fruits or bear the consequences of such critical national policy.

## 12)  Push  for  Public  Consultation,  Open  Discussion  with  Stakeholders  and Robust Parliamentary Debates on Nuclear Power Proposals

The government revealed in Budget 2025 that they will study the potential deployment of nuclear power in Singapore. Despite the claim that the more advanced nuclear technology, e.g. small modular reactors (SMRs), has better safety features than the conventional large plants, it still lacks long-term safety data given its relatively short implementation history. Singapore's compactness could also limit our choice of emergency planning zone. Besides safety concerns, the cost-effectiveness of power  supply is another key consideration.  Studies  show  that  SMRs  can  only  be  more  cost-effective  than larger conventional reactors when many SMRs are in operation. Other studies find that SMRs will produce more nuclear waste to be managed and disposed of. Therefore, PPP urges robust Parliamentary debate, open discussion with various stakeholders, and comprehensive public consultation without any preset policy stance before deciding the way forward.

## 13) Democratic Reform

The  current  GRC  system  has  given  PAP  enormous  leverage  to  maintain  a supermajority in parliament with only 61% of popular votes won. We propose an overhaul of our electoral system by introducing Proportional Representation  to  parliamentary  election. Amid  an  increasingly  complex world development, we need a more diverse parliamentary representation to prevent groupthink and from degrading to an echo chamber when debating policies.  The  introduction  of  Proportional  Representation  in  the  GRC  system can eliminate  the  need  for  gerrymandering . It can  also  get  rid  of  the suspicion of unfair election practices whenever the constituency boundaries are  redrawn.  Our  electoral  system  will  become  more  robust,  just  and  fair  to political participants, which will in turn benefit voters.

# Reminder

Good Governance cannot be taken for granted. The practice of 'Ownself Checks Ownself' should never be 'normalized' because it fails to ensure the effective functioning of a responsible government , which should always prioritize people's interests and wellbeing. A proper system of checks and balances must be institutionalized to maintain a competent administration and a government free from power abuse and corruption.

# Concluding Remarks

Our Vision for Singapore is to create the Best Quality Life for All Singaporeans - not just today, but for generations to come.

Singaporeans'  interests should  always  be  our TOP  priority. There is absolutely nothing wrong with protecting Our People, Our Culture, Our Values, Our  Way  of  Life  and  Our  Jobs  from  being  taken  away  or  compromised  by external forces or excessive immigrants.

We are  facing  an Existential  Threat  of  Extinction due  to  PAP's  unchecked policies in the past, namely 'Two is Enough' family planning policy, HDB Asset Enhancement Scheme for pushing up property prices rapidly, and aggressive immigration policy for squeezing out our local workforce. It is high time for the country to conduct a comprehensive review of how Singaporeans want our HOME to become in future .

Some of our friends,  family  members,  and  even  residents  we've  met  on  our political journey have shared that they feel 'demoralized and helpless.' Sadly, many have made the difficult decision to leave the country they once called home. This trend is growing, especially among the younger generation, who feel disheartened by a system that should have uplifted them.

People's Power Party has A Wish: WE are born on this land where we call HOME WE grow up together through THICK &amp; THIN WE build our career and raise our children as we ASPIRE WE fight for and serve our country and people WITHOUT REGRET WE want to enjoy the fruits of our hard work and Singapore's SUCCESS DON'T be disheartened and leave this land where we help BUILD TOGETHER let's make Singapore our HOME AGAIN

This is  PPP's  conviction for Singapore and our people. Our Party's vision and mission  for  this  country  extends  beyond  the  next  5  years  but  many  more decades  to  come.  We  urge  all  Singaporeans  to  give  PPP  your  vote  of confidence.  Our  Party  looks  forward  to  having  the  privilege  to  serve  you  in Parliament,  where  we  will  be  empowered  to  defend  your  rights  and  bring positive changes to our lives.
